Subject: 1.1) What is an Atari 8-bit computer?

Based in Silicon Valley in the USA, the company known as Atari produced a line
of home computers from 1979 to 1992 often referred to collectively as the
"Atari 8-bits," the "8-bit Ataris," the "400/800/XL/XE series," etc.

The computers included the 400, 800, 1200XL, 600XL, 800XL, 65XE, 130XE, 800XE,
and the XE game system.

Notable home computers that were introduced before the Atari 400/800:
1977: Apple II, Commodore PET, Tandy TRS-80 (Model I)

Notable home computers that were introduced after the Atari 400/800:
1979: Texas Instruments TI-99/4
1980: Commodore VIC-20, Tandy TRS-80 Color Computer, Osborne 1, Sinclair ZX80
1981: Texas Instruments TI-99/4A, IBM PC, Sinclair ZX81, Acorn BBC Micro
1982: Kaypro II, Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64
1983: Coleco Adam, MSX
1984: Apple Macintosh, Amstrad CPC
1985: Atari ST, Commodore Amiga
1987: Acorn Archimedes

In marketing their computers to the public, Atari always had to contend with
their company history and reputation as a maker of video games.  While the
8-bit Atari computers in their heyday were technically quite comparable if not
superior in the worlds of home and business personal computing, they also live
up to the name "Atari" with a huge library of video games which were often
outstanding for their time.

The 8-bit Atari computers do not use the same cartridges or floppy disks as
any other Atari platforms, such as the 2600 Video Computer System (VCS), the
5200 SuperSystem, the 7800 ProSystem, or the ST/TT/Falcon computers.  All of
these but the 5200, however, do share (essentially) the same joystick/
controller hardware port.

While the 5200 controller ports are different, the 5200 hardware platform is
very closely related the 8-bit Atari computers, including use of the same
custom chipset (SALLY/ANTIC/GTIA/POKEY).  Differences include a fixed 16KiB of
RAM, fixed 32KiB ROM cartridge size, a physically different cartridge port,
and a much smaller 2KiB operating system.

Here are some of the hardware performance specifications of the 8-bit Atari
computers:

 - Player-Missile 0-3 (used in GTIA Mode 2; Player-Missiles discussed below)

Each color register holds both a color/hue setting and a luminance/brightness
setting.  In most graphics modes, each of the available color registers may
hold any one of 16 colors/hues combined with any one of 8 luminance/brightness
settings, for a total palette of 128 possible colors.

In GTIA Mode 1 only, with the GTIA chip only, the 16 available colors/hues can
each be combined with 16 different luminance/brightness settings, for a total
palette of 256 possible colors.

Character sets of 128 8x8 characters, each with a normal and an inverse
video incarnation, are totally redefinable.

PLAYER-MISSILE GRAPHICS:
    The Atari term for "sprites" where a sprite is a graphical video display
    object handled independendly from the memory bitmap of the video display.

    Four 8-bit wide, 120 or 240 byte high single color Players, and four
    2-bit wide, 120 or 240 byte high single color Missiles are available.
    A mode to combine the 4 Missiles into a 5th 8-bit wide Player is also
    available, as is a mode to OR colors or blacken out colors when Players
    overlap (good for making three colors out of two Players!)  Players
    and Missiles have adjustable priority and collision detection.

DISPLAY LIST:
    Screen modes can be mixed (by lines) down the screen using the Display
    List - a program which is executed by the ANTIC graphics chip every
    screen refresh.

DISPLAY LIST INTERRUPTS (DLIs):
    Other screen attributes (color, player/missile horizontal position,
    screen width, player/missile/playfield priority, etc.) can be adjusted
    at any point down the screen via DLIs.

SCROLLING:
    Fine scrolling (both vertical and horizontal) can be enabled on any
    line on the screen.

SOUND:
    Sound output is monaural/monophonic, or single channel (except for the 
    400/800 where the Console Speaker outputs to a separate, internal 
    speaker).

    Up to 5 separate simultaneous voices can be produced, where the four main
    voices can be configured in one of the following three ways:
     - 4 voices, each with one of 256 unique frequencies/pitches
     - 2 voices, each with one of 65,536 unique frequencies/pitches
     - 1 voice with one of 65,536 frequencies/pitches and 2 voices with one of
       256 frequencies/pitches each

    Each of the four main voices may be produced with one of 8 available
    "noise" settings/polynomial-counter combinations, commonly called
    "distortion" settings.  (There are actually only 6 distinct combinations
    of 3 poly-counters offered, but one of the poly-counters has 2 available
    settings itself, resulting in 2 additional noise settings for the total of
    8 available.)

    Each of the four main voices may be produced at one of 16 volumes.

    Also for each of the four main voices, direct control of the position of
    the speaker cone, known today as pulse-code modulation or PCM, is
    available as well, at a bit depth of 4 bits, for a volume resolution of 16
    possible values (4-bit PCM).  This is known as "Volume Control only" mode
    on the Atari.

    The fifth available voice is known as the Console Speaker.  This voice was
    intended only for system keyclick and buzzer, but it may also be
    programmed as 1-bit PCM.

VERTICAL BLANK INTERRUPTS (VBIs):
    A software routine may be designed to execute as a VBI.  There are two
    varieties of VBI: Immediate and Deferred.  An Immediate VBI completes 
    execution within the vertical blank time, which is the time allotted for a
    CRT display to shut the electron beam off at the lower-right of the 
    display and reposition it back on the top-left of the display to commence
    drawing of the next frame.  A Deferred VBI routine completes execution
    between the initiation of one vertical blank and the next.

Atari 8-bit computers were supplied with the proprietary Atari Operating
System contained in Read Only Memory (ROM) as an integral feature of the
computer.  The Atari OS is described elsewhere in this FAQ List.

Subject: 1.2) What is the Atari 400?

Introduced in January 1979 alongside the Atari 800 and shipped that fall, the
Atari 400 was the reduced feature set version of the new Atari personal
computer system.  

The 400 is the only 8-bit Atari with a membrane keyboard rather than a full-
stroke keyboard, and is one of the few 8-bit Atari computers lacking a
composite monitor port.  Controller Jacks #1-3 on the 400 are the only ones on
any 8-bit Atari that do not support a light pen / light gun.  The 400 was
originally released with just 8KiB RAM, but most were sold with 16KiB RAM.  As
of June 1983 Atari released the 48K RAM Expansion Kit for the 400, installed
through Atari service centers or offered as a kit through the Atari Program
Exchange (APX).

Any internal plug-in RAM board for the 400 can also be used in the front RAM
slot of the 800.

Features unique to the 400/800 models relative to other Atari computers:
 - Television (TV) connecting cable, not designed to be removable, emerges 
   directly from center of rear of computer case 
 - Four controller (joystick) ports
 - Internal speaker for keyclicks and system buzzer
 - Memo Pad / Blackboard mode
 - +12 volt supply on pin 12 of the SIO port
 - Internal plug-in 400/800 CPU Board (28/56 pin edge connector)

System initialization types supported:
 - Memo Pad: Turn on computer with no cartridge inserted and no powered disk
   drive #1.
 - Cartridge: Turn on computer with cartridge inserted.
 - Cassette boot: (boot cassette may or may not require cartridge inserted)
    1. Hold down [START] while turning on the computer. (system buzzer sounds)
    2. Press [PLAY] on the program recorder with boot cassette inserted.
    3. Press [RETURN] on the computer.
 - Disk boot: (boot disk may or may not require cartridge inserted)
    Turn on computer with boot disk inserted in powered disk drive #1.

Subject: 1.3) What is the Atari 800?

Introduced in January 1979 alongside the Atari 400 and shipped that fall, the
Atari 800 was the full feature set version of the new Atari personal computer
system.  The 800 is the only 8-bit Atari with a Right Cartridge slot, in
addition to the Left Cartridge slot as present on all 8-bit Ataris.  The 800
was originally released with just 8KiB RAM, many were sold with 16KiB, and
later on 48KiB was standard.

The 800 is the only 8-bit Atari where the Operating System is contained in a
plug-in Personality Module (Atari CX801 10K ROM or compatible), and where RAM
is contained in one, two, or three plug-in Memory Modules (Atari CX852 8K RAM,
Atari CX853 16K RAM, or compatibles).  800 RAM totals of 8KiB, 16KiB, 24KiB,
32KiB, 40KiB, or 48KiB were supported by Atari.

Features unique to the 400/800 models relative to other Atari computers:
 - Television (TV) connecting cable, not designed to be removable, emerges 
   directly from center of rear of computer case 
 - Four controller (joystick) ports
 - Internal speaker for keyclicks and system buzzer

Subject: 1.4) What is the Atari 1200XL?

Introduced in December 1982 and shipped in March 1983, the Atari 1200XL was
intended to be the first in a new generation of computers to replace the Atari
400/800 while maintaining compatibility with the earlier models.

Innovations relative to the 400/800 include a full 64KiB of RAM and a
significantly revised XL Operating System (ROM expanded from 10KiB to 14KiB).

The 1200XL is the only 8-bit Atari computer to feature two LED indicator
lights (L1, L2).  Normally they are both &lt;OFF&gt;.  L1 &lt;ON&gt; means the keyboard is
disabled.  L2 &lt;ON&gt; means the new International Character Set is selected.

Keyboard enhancements introduced with the 1200XL include the new [HELP] key as
well as four programmable functions keys ([F1], [F2], [F3], [F4]).  Console
Speaker sounds (keyclicks and system beeps) output through the built-in
speaker on the 400/800 are heard from the television or monitor speaker on the
1200XL.  The toggle action of the [CAPS] key was altered compared to the
400/800.  The key auto-repeat rate is user-alterable.  The [RESET] key is
directly wired to the SALLY 6502 reset line.

  1200XL Function key effects, redefinable:
     [F1] Cursor up          [SHIFT]+[F1] Cursor to upper-left corner (home)
     [F2] Cursor down        [SHIFT]+[F2] Cursor to lower-left corner
     [F3] Cursor left        [SHIFT]+[F3] Cursor to start of physical line
     [F4] Cursor right       [SHIFT]+[F4] Cursor to end of physical line

  1200XL Function key effects, non-redefinable:
     [CONTROL]+[F1] Keyboard enable/disable (console keys unaffected)
     [CONTROL]+[F2] Screen DMA (ANTIC) enable/disable
     [CONTROL]+[F3] Key click sound enable/disable
     [CONTROL]+[F4] Domestic/International character set toggle

Additional 1200XL Operating System enhancements compared to the 400/800 OS:
 - Text screen fine scrolling is available
 - The Resident Diskette Handler can read/write disk sectors having variable
   length from 1 to 65536 bytes.
   Default = 128 bytes (matching the 400/800 static value)
 - The Resident Diskette Handler can write a sector to the disk without a
   read-verify operation always following it.
 - Universal OS for both NTSC and PAL systems (including independent values
   for cassette timings and for keyboard auto-repeat functions)

A few features from the 400/800 are lacking in the 1200XL.  Most prominently,
the 1200XL has only 2 controller ports, and no Memo Pad / Blackboard mode.

With the 1200XL Atari made an apparent decision to preclude peripherals from
drawing their power from the computer via the SIO bus:
 - The 1200XL lacks +12V on SIO pin 12, as was available on the 400/800.
 - On the 1200XL the +5V/Ready line (pin 10) on the SIO port supplies enough
   current for the Ready ("Computer On") function but not enough current for
   peripherals designed to use the line as their power source.
   ("FIX": Replace 100 Ohm resistor R63 with a 0 Ohm to 1 Ohm resistor, or a
   jumper wire.)

The labels on some several of the 1200XL keyboard keys differ slightly from
those of the 400/800: 400/800                1200XL
                    [CTRL]             --&gt; [CONTROL]
                    [SYSTEM RESET]     --&gt; [RESET]
                    [CAPS LOWR]        --&gt; [CAPS]
                    [DELETE BACK S]    --&gt; [DELETE BACK SPACE]
                    "Atari logo" key   --&gt; "Inverse video" key

System initialization types supported:
 - "ATARI" rainbow logo/graphics demo screen: Turn on computer with no
   cartridge inserted and no powered disk drive #1.
     - Press [HELP] from the "ATARI" logo screen to access Self Test program.
 - Cartridge: Turn on computer with cartridge inserted.
 - Cassette boot: (boot cassette may or may not require cartridge inserted)
    1. Hold down [START] while turning on the computer. (system buzzer sounds)
    2. Press [PLAY] on the program recorder with boot cassette inserted.
    3. Press [RETURN] on the computer.

Power: Used with an external 9 volt AC transformer power supply, input power
31 VA; shipped with Atari CA017964.

The 1200XL was made in the USA from January 1983 to May 1983, and in Taiwan
from April 1983 to July 1983.

By analyzing 1200XL serial numbers, Karl Heller estimates that fewer than
120,000 units total were produced, and possibly fewer than 100,000.  See the
"1200XL Owners List" thread on AtariAge:

Scott Stilphen mentioned this 1200XL easter egg on 10 Feb 2006:
   On 1200XLs, if you select 'all tests', when it gets to the keyboard test
   it'll type out the programmer's name.

Subject: 1.5) What is the Atari 600XL?

Introduced in June 1983 alongside the 800XL, 1400XL (never shipped), and
1450XLD (never shipped), and shipped that fall, the Atari 600XL was the
low-end machine in the new range of computers that would replace the Atari
400/800/1200XL while maintaining compatibility with the earlier models.

The 600XL/800XL include most of the features of the 1200XL, minus the 4
Function keys, the 2 LED lights, and the "ATARI" logo screen.  In addition,
the 600XL/800XL offer the Parallel Bus Interface (PBI), providing fast
parallel access to the heart of the computer.  

Available current on the +5V/Ready line (pin 10) on the SIO port of the
600XL/800XL matches that on the 400/800, restoring compatibility with SIO
peripherals designed to draw power from that line which would not work on the
1200XL.

The 600XL contains 16KiB RAM, and has the Atari XL OS and Atari BASIC on ROM.
The Atari 1064 Memory Module expands the 600XL from 16KiB to 64KiB RAM. 

System initialization types supported:
 - Atari BASIC: Turn on computer with no cartridge inserted and no powered
   disk drive #1.
 - Self Test program: Hold down [OPTION] while turning on the computer with no
   cartridge inserted and no powered disk drive #1.
 - Cartridge: Turn on computer with cartridge inserted. (disables BASIC)
 - Cassette boot: (boot cassette may or may not require BASIC or cartridge)
    1. - With BASIC or with cartridge (cartridge disables BASIC):
           Hold down [START] while turning on the computer.
       - With no cartridge and without BASIC:
           Hold down both [START] and [OPTION] while turning on the computer. 
       (system buzzer sounds)
    2. Press [PLAY] on the program recorder with boot cassette inserted.
    3. Press [RETURN] on the computer.
 - Disk boot: (boot disk may or may not require BASIC or cartridge inserted)
    - With BASIC or with cartridge (cartridge disables BASIC): 
        Turn on computer with boot disk inserted in powered disk drive #1.
    - With no cartridge and without BASIC:
        Hold down [OPTION] while turning on computer with boot disk inserted
        in powered disk drive #1.

Rare variations of the 600XL:
  o  Some late-model 600XLs were sold with 64KiB RAM.  These may have only
appeared in Canada.  The box had a round gold foil sticker reading:
"64k Memory -- Now with a full 64k of memory built-in."

Subject: 1.6) What is the Atari 800XL?

Introduced in June 1983 alongside the 600XL, 1400XL (never shipped), and
1450XLD (never shipped), and shipped that fall, the Atari 800XL was one of the
new range of computers that would replace the Atari 400/800/1200XL while
maintaining compatibility with the earlier models.

The 600XL/800XL include most of the features of the 1200XL, minus the 4
Function keys, the 2 LED lights, and the "ATARI" logo screen.  But both the
600XL and 800XL have the Atari BASIC language built-in.  In addition, these
two systems offer the Parallel Bus Interface (PBI), providing fast parallel
access to the heart of the computer.  

Available current on the +5V/Ready line (pin 10) on the SIO port of the
600XL/800XL matches that on the 400/800, restoring compatibility with SIO
peripherals designed to draw power from that line which would not work on the
1200XL.

The 800XL contains 64KiB RAM, and has the Atari XL OS and Atari BASIC on ROM.

System initialization types supported:
 - Atari BASIC: Turn on computer with no cartridge inserted and no powered
   disk drive #1.
 - Self Test program: Hold down [OPTION] while turning on the computer with no
   cartridge inserted and no powered disk drive #1.
 - Cartridge: Turn on computer with cartridge inserted. (disables BASIC)
 - Cassette boot: (boot cassette may or may not require BASIC or cartridge)
    1. - With BASIC or with cartridge (cartridge disables BASIC):
           Hold down [START] while turning on the computer.
       - With no cartridge and without BASIC:
           Hold down both [START] and [OPTION] while turning on the computer. 
       (system buzzer sounds)
    2. Press [PLAY] on the program recorder with boot cassette inserted.
    3. Press [RETURN] on the computer.
 - Disk boot: (boot disk may or may not require BASIC or cartridge inserted)
    - With BASIC or with cartridge (cartridge disables BASIC): 
        Turn on computer with boot disk inserted in powered disk drive #1.
    - With no cartridge and without BASIC:
        Hold down [OPTION] while turning on computer with boot disk inserted
        in powered disk drive #1.

Subject: 1.9) What is the Atari XE game system?

With the February 1987 introduction of the Atari XE game system, Atari both
extended the established 65XE/130XE product line and also added a third game
system to complement the established 2600 and 7800 product lines.

Termed variously by Atari as the XE Video Game System, the XE Game System, or
the XE System, the name was actually trademarked by Atari as simply: XE.
(For clarity, this FAQ List will normally use "XE game system" or "XEgs".)

The core component of the XEgs is the XE System Console, which is essentially
a complete 65XE/800XE but without a keyboard.  A companion XE System Keyboard
was produced and often sold with the Console.

The XE System Console offers 64KiB RAM, and has the Atari XL OS Rev.4 (14KiB),
Atari BASIC Rev. C (8KiB), and Missile Command (8KiB) all built-in on ROM (all
on a single 32KiB ROM chip; 2KiB is unused), C101687.

Distinctive hardware features of the XE System Console:
 - Keyboard Port (for the separate XE System Keyboard)
 - Audio jack (phono)
 - Video jack (phono, providing composite video)

65XE/130XE/800XE features not present on the XE System Console:
 - No Enhanced Cartridge Interface (ECI)
 - NTSC/PAL versions: No Monitor port
 - SECAM version: No Television jack

System initialization types supported:
 - Cartridge: Press [Power] on the Console with cartridge inserted.
   (disables BASIC and Missile Command)
 - Atari BASIC, Missile Command, Self Test, Cassette boot, or Disk boot:
   (boot cassette or boot disk may or may not require BASIC or cartridge)

Subject: 1.10) What is the Atari 800XE?

The Atari 800XE was announced (not by name at the time) in March 1987 in West
Germany, and shipped later that year as a regional complement to the Atari
65XE and 130XE.  The 800XE name was selected in a marketing attempt to
capitalize on the recent and surprisingly swift final sellout of available
inventory of new 800XL units.  (The 800XE was never introduced in the U.S.)

The 800XE is identical to the common PAL B version of the 65XE, utilizing the
same PAL 130XE motherboard with Enhanced Cartridge Interface (ECI).

The 800XE offers 64KiB RAM, and has the Atari XL OS and Atari BASIC on ROM.

System initialization types supported:
 - Atari BASIC: Turn on computer with no cartridge inserted and no powered
   disk drive #1.
 - Self Test program: Hold down [Option] while turning on the computer with no
   cartridge inserted and no powered disk drive #1.
 - Cartridge: Turn on computer with cartridge inserted. (disables BASIC)
 - Cassette boot: (boot cassette may or may not require BASIC or cartridge)
    1. - With BASIC or with cartridge (cartridge disables BASIC):
           Hold down [Start] while turning on the computer.
       - With no cartridge and without BASIC:
           Hold down both [Start] and [Option] while turning on the computer. 
       (system buzzer sounds)
    2. Press [PLAY] on the program recorder with boot cassette inserted.
    3. Press [Return] on the computer.
 - Disk boot: (boot disk may or may not require BASIC or cartridge inserted)
    - With BASIC or with cartridge (cartridge disables BASIC): 
        Turn on computer with boot disk inserted in powered disk drive #1.
    - With no cartridge and without BASIC:
        Hold down [Option] while turning on computer with boot disk inserted
        in powered disk drive #1.

Subject: 1.11) What were the Atari 1400XL, 1450XLD, 65XEP, and 65XEM?

Atari publicly introduced or announced several computers in the tradition of
the 400/800/XL/XE series that ultimately never shipped.

The 1400XL was introduced by Atari, Inc. alongside the 600XL, 800XL, and
1450XLD at the June 1983 Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago.
Resembling the 1200XL in appearance, the 1400XL was to provide the features of
the 800XL plus a built-in 300 baud modem with ModemLink software and a built-
in speech synthesizer (Votrax SC-01).  Prototype units exist, but the 1400XL
never shipped.  <a href=http://www.atarimuseum.com/computers/8BITS/XL/1400xl/1400.html>http://www.atarimuseum.com/computers/8BITS/XL/1400xl/1400.html</a>

The 1450XLD was introduced by Atari, Inc. alongside the 600XL, 800XL, and
1400XL at the June 1983 Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago.  The
1450XLD was to provide the features of the 1400XL plus a built-in double
sided, dual/enhanced density 260KiB 5.25" floppy disk drive, with expansion
space for a second disk drive.  Atari continued to promote the 1450XLD through
June 1984.  Prototype units exist, but the 1450XLD never shipped.
<a href=http://www.atarimuseum.com/computers/8BITS/XL/1450xld/1450xld.html>http://www.atarimuseum.com/computers/8BITS/XL/1450xld/1450xld.html</a>

The 65XEP was introduced by Atari, Corp. alongside the 65XE and 130XE at the
January 1985 Winter Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.  The portable
65XEP was to provide the features of the 65XE, plus built-in 5" monochrome CRT
display and 360KiB 3.5" disk drive.  The 65XEP never shipped, and possibly
only the single original mockup display prototype unit ever existed.
<a href=http://www.cyberroach.com/cyromag/14/DSCN3934.jpg>http://www.cyberroach.com/cyromag/14/DSCN3934.jpg</a>

The 65XEM was announced (but not shown) by Atari, Corp. at the January 1985
Winter Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.  The 65XEM was to provide the
features of the 65XE, plus advanced sound/voice synthesis capabilities thanks
to the addition of the AMY Sound Processor chip.  Eight voices giving rich
music giving the following features: (Page 6 #14 Mar/Apr 85)
 - Digital sample rate in excess of 30kHz.  Over 60dB dynamic range.
 - Fundamental Frequency Range of 4.8Hz to 7.8kHz -10 2/3 octaves.
 - Fundamental Frequency Resolution of 1/64 semitones.
 - Precise control of harmonic amplitudes.  64 harmonics.  
The 65XEM never shipped, and no more than a handful of prototype units may
exist.

Subject: 1.12) What are SALLY, ANTIC, CTIA/GTIA/FGTIA, POKEY, and FREDDIE?

Portions of this section derived from De Re Atari.

The internal layout of the Atari 8-bit computer is very different from other
systems.  It of course has a microprocessor (a 6502), random-access memory
(RAM), read-only memory (ROM), and a peripheral interface adapter (PIA).
However, it also has three special-purpose large-scale integration (LSI) chips
known as ANTIC, one of CTIA/GTIA/FGTIA, and POKEY.  These chips were designed
by Atari engineers primarily to take much of the burden of housekeeping off of
the 6502, thereby freeing the 6502 to concentrate on computations.  While they
were at it, they designed a great deal of power into these chips.  Each of
these chips is almost as big (in terms of silicon area) as a 6502, so the
three of them together provide a tremendous amount of power.  Mastering the
Atari 8-bit computers is primarily a matter of mastering these three chips.


6502 MPU  -- MOS Technology MCS6502A or equivalent (400/800,most NTSC):C014377
========          Atari SALLY (400/800,late NTSC &amp; all PAL; XL/XE,all):C014806
The MCS6502 microprocessor unit (MPU) was designed by Chuck Peddle and Bill
Mensch for MOS Technology.  It was released in 1975, just after the short-
lived MCS6501.  The 6501/6502 were the first two releases in the MCS6500
Microcomputer System product line (which was compatible with the Motorola
M6800 bus structure).  MOS Technology was acquired by Commodore Business
Machines (CBM) in 1976, and would later operate as Commodore Semiconductor
Group (CSG).  Versions of the 6502 were used in the popular Apple II and
Commodore PET, and the popularity of the chip led MOS Technology to license
other companies such as Rockwell and Synertek to second-source the 6502 and
support components.

MCS6502A equivalents shipped in most NTSC Atari 400/800 computers and marked
with the Atari part number C014377 include the Synertek SY6500 Series
Microprocessors P6502A and P6502B, and the Rockwell R6502-34.

Later production NTSC 400/800 computers, all PAL 400/800 computers, and all of
the Atari XL/XE computer models contain Atari's proprietary version of the
6502 chip.  This chip was originally named SALLY by Atari engineers, but Atari
Customer Support documents (Field Services Manuals) variously described it as
"6502 (Modified)", "6502 Modified", "Custom 6502", or "6502C".  Field Service
Manuals published by Atari, Corp./Atari Corporation reverted to using the
chip's original name, SALLY, while Atari, Corp./Atari Corporation XE consumer
owner's manuals (unfortunately) continued to use "6502C" in reference to the
SALLY 6502.

Several manufacturers produced the SALLY 6502 for Atari, including MOS
Technology, Synertek, Rockwell, NCR, and United Microelectronics (UMC).  It is
important to note that chips marked "6502C" such as the MOS Technology
MCS6502C, MOS Technology MPS6502C, Synertek SY6502C, Rockwell R6502C, or UMC
UM6502C are NOT the Atari "6502C" --these are all equivalents to the standard
MOS Technology MCS6502.  Atari SALLY 6502 chips are never marked "6502C" but,
other than the UMC UM6502I, always carry the Atari part number C014806.

In contrast to the MCS6502 and equivalents, the SALLY 6502 has the addition of
a /HALT signal on pin 35.  The SALLY 6502 also has a second R/W signal on pin
36 (in addition to pin 34).  Pins 35 and 36 are not connected on the MCS6502
and equivalents.

The Atari's second microprocessor, ANTIC, must routinely interrupt the 6502 in
order to utilize the processor bus for itself for direct memory access (DMA).
/HALT on the SALLY 6502 facilitates this system design.  Atari's earlier
implementation of the same functionality in the 400/800 using the MCS6502 or
equivalent requires a series of 4 additional chips that are unnecessary in
computers designed for the SALLY 6502.  

Other systems utilizing the Atari SALLY 6502 chip:
 - Atari 5200
 - Exidy Max-A-Flex coin-operated arcade conversion system
   (embedded Atari 600XL): Astro Chase, Boulder Dash, Bristles, Flip and Flop
 - Atari 7800

ANTIC  --      ANTIC,NTSC:C012296            ANTIC,PAL:C014887
=====      ANTIC 'E',NTSC:C021697        ANTIC 'B',PAL:C021698
 - ANTIC shipped in all 400/800/1200XL units and earlier 800XL units.
 - ANTIC 'E'/'B' shipped in all 600XL, later 800XL, and all XE units.

ANTIC ("AlphaNumeric Television Interface Controller" --FD100001 Rev.02 p.1-8)
is a microprocessor dedicated to the television display.  It is a true
microprocessor; it has an instruction set, a program (called the display
list), and data.  The display list and the display data are written into RAM
by the 6502.  ANTIC retrieves this information from RAM using direct memory
access (DMA).  It processes the higher level instructions in the display list
and translates these instructions into a real-time stream of simple
instructions to CTIA/GTIA/FGTIA.

Specific ANTIC functions include:
 - DMA (Direct Memory Access) control.  2 types of "Display DMA" (also known
   as "cycle stealing") are:
     1) Playfield DMA - Execution of display list instructions in RAM.
     2) Player-Missile DMA - Automatic fetching of player-missile graphics
        data from RAM for CTIA/GTIA/FGTIA.
     Also automatically generates DMA addresses for the automatic refresh of
     the system's dynamic memory RAM (DRAM) chip(s).  The earlier ANTIC
     version generates 7 bits of addresses, while the (backward compatible)
     ANTIC 'E'/'B' versions generate 8 bits of addresses for DRAM memory
     refresh.  This is the only difference between ANTIC and ANTIC 'E'/'B'.
 - NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt) control.  3 types of NMI on the Atari are: 
     1) Display List Interrupt (DLI)
     2) Vertical Blank Interrupt (VBI)
     3) System Reset (key)
 - Vertical and Horizontal fine scrolling
 - Light pen / light gun horizontal and vertical position registers
    - Updated upon pulse of any of the Joystick Trigger lines
       - Exception: 400 Controller Jacks 1-3 Trigger lines are not connected
         to ANTIC.
 - Vertical line counter
 - WSYNC (wait for horizontal sync) command -- allows the microprocessor to
   synchronize itself to the TV horizontal line rate

Other systems utilizing the Atari ANTIC chip:
 - Atari 5200
 - Exidy Max-A-Flex coin-operated arcade conversion system
   (embedded Atari 600XL): Astro Chase, Boulder Dash, Bristles, Flip and Flop

CTIA/GTIA/FGTIA  --  CTIA(NTSC):C012295       GTIA,PAL:C014889

Early NTSC 400/800 units shipped with CTIA.  Later NTSC 400/800 units, all PAL
400/800 units, and all NTSC XL/XE and PAL XL/XE systems include GTIA.  SECAM
800XL, 130XE and XE System Console units include FGTIA.

The NTSC versions of CTIA/GTIA were designed to interface with the NTSC 
version of ANTIC.  The PAL version of GTIA and the FGTIA were designed to
interface with the PAL version of ANTIC.

The CTIA, GTIA, or FGTIA is the television interface chip.  ANTIC directly
controls most of the operations of the CTIA/GTIA/FGTIA, although the 6502 can
also be programmed to intercede and control some or all of the functions of
the CTIA/GTIA/FGTIA.  The CTIA/GTIA/FGTIA converts the digital commands
from ANTIC (or the 6502) into the video signal output.

In addition to its basic television/video interface function, the
CTIA/GTIA/FGTIA performs color-luminance control for the entire video signal,
player-missile control, and both priority control and collision detection
among player-missiles and the background.  The CTIA/GTIA/FGTIA also reads the
controller port trigger inputs and the console keys (Start/Select/Option), and
it generates Console Speaker sounds.  In the XL/XE, the GTIA/FGTIA senses the
presence of an active ROM cartridge, and in the XE System Console the
GTIA/FGTIA senses the presense of an XE Keyboard.

The GTIA is backward compatible with the CTIA, with the GTIA simply making
available three additional graphics modes (GTIA Modes 1-3).  Notably, both the
400/800 OS Rev.A and Atari BASIC Rev. A were GTIA-ready from their 1979
release.  By way of explanation, Robin Sherer of Santa Cruz Education Software
was quoted in InfoWorld 3/15/82 regarding GTIA:
  "They had it designed before the computer even went to market.  They
  had already ordered 100,000 of the CTIAs--that's the rumored number.  Not
  wanting to throw away chips, they introduced [computers] in this country
  with the CTIA."

The FGTIA is software compatible with the GTIA.  However, in GTIA Mode 1 the
FGTIA can only display 8 distinct luminances, compared to the 16 distinct
luminances that can be displayed in GTIA Mode 1 by the GTIA.

Whether CTIA or GTIA/FGTIA is installed can be determined by observing what
happens as a result of trying to enter a GTIA graphics mode.  In Atari BASIC,
at the "READY" prompt, type POKE 623,64 [RETURN].  If the screen blackens, you
have the GTIA or FGTIA chip.  If it stays blue, you have the early CTIA chip.

Bill Wilkinson offers a technique whereby software can determine whether a
CTIA or a GTIA is installed in his "Insight: Atari" column in the January 1983
(#32) issue of Compute!, page 171, see:
<a href=http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue32/085_1_INSIGHT_ATARI.php>http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue32/085_1_INSIGHT_ATARI.php</a>

A substantial number of late-production Atari XE computer systems, especially
later 800XE computers made in China, shipped with moderately defective GTIA
chips.  This page (in Polish) details the scope of the issue, including how to
detect whether a given computer contains one of the faulty GTIA chips:

POKEY  --  C012294
=====
POKEY (name derived from POtentiometer and KEYboard) is a digital input/output
(I/O) chip.  It handles such disparate tasks as the serial I/O bus (SIO),
audio generation, keyboard scan, timers, and random number generation.  It
also digitizes the resistive paddle inputs and controls selected maskable
interrupt (IRQ) requests from peripherals (other IRQs are handled by the PIA).

Other systems utilizing the Atari POKEY chip:
 - 40 production coin-operated arcade games released by Atari or Atari Games,
   from Missile Command (June 1980) to Tetris and Vindicators Part II (both
   released February 1989).  (Thanks to Laurent Delsarte for the list.)
 - Centuri Tunnel Hunt, coin-operated arcade game licensed from Atari
 - Atari 5200
 - Exidy Max-A-Flex coin-operated arcade conversion system
   (embedded Atari 600XL): Astro Chase, Boulder Dash, Bristles, Flip and Flop
 - Atari Ballblazer and Commando cartridges for the Atari 7800

FREDDIE  --  800XL(late),XE(all):C061922/C061991
=======
According to Atari's design specification, the "Freddie RAM" Memory Control
Unit (MCU) is a custom LSI chip providing dynamic RAM (DRAM) control
functions.  It replaces a number of small-scale integration (SSI) and medium-
scale integration (MSI) transistor-transistor logic (TTL) parts, including a
custom delay line.  FREDDIE multiplexes 16-bit RAM addresses from the
processor bus into 8-bit row and 8-bit column addresses for direct use in the
DRAM, and it generates row and column DRAM address timing strobes.

FREDDIE was initially designed by Atari, Inc. in 1983 as chip that would cut
production costs for future XL computers.  FREDDIE was finally incorporated
into late-production 800XL computers and in all XE computer systems.

"FREDDIE" or "FREDDY"?
Atari technical documentation consistently uses "FREDDIE" while Atari consumer
documentation (Owner's Manuals for all XE systems) consistently uses "FREDDY."
This FAQ List adopts the convention from Atari's technical documentation:
"FREDDIE"

6520 PIA  --  MOS Technology MCS6520A or equivalent: C012298 or C014795
========
The 8-bit Atari uses the MOS Technology MCS6520A or equivalent as a peripheral
interface adapter (PIA).  The 6520 is itself a clone of the earlier Motorola
MC6820 PIA.

MCS6520A equivalents shipped in Atari computers include: Synertek P6520A

Subject: 1.15) What issues surround NTSC vs. PAL vs. SECAM computer versions?

Some quick definitions first:

NTSC: "National Television Standards Committee"
TV signal standard used in North America, Central America, a number of South
American countries, and some Asian countries, including Japan.
  o  525 lines per frame
  o  60 half-frames per second (interlaced) = 60Hz
  o  Complete frame refreshed 30 times per second

PAL: "Phase Alternation by Line"
TV signal standard used in the United Kingdom, most of the rest of Europe,
several South American countries, some Middle East and Asian countries,
several African countries, Australia, New Zealand, and other Pacific island
countries.
  o  625 lines per frame
  o  50 half-frames per second (interlaced) = 50Hz
  o  Complete frame refreshed 25 times per second.

SECAM: "Sequentiel couleur avec memoire"
TV signal standard still used in France, the former USSR, and some African
countries.  Until the 1980s SECAM was the standard in eastern Europe,
including East Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary.
  o  625 lines per frame
  o  50 half-frames per second (interlaced) = 50Hz
  o  Complete frame refreshed 25 times per second.

While the above draws a clear distinction between NTSC and PAL/SECAM, a
further discussion of the NTSC/PAL/SECAM color encoding systems will help to
distinguish between all three standards.

=-=-=-=-=
This discussion by Laurent Delsarte (2008.12) (with minor edits by mc).

First of all, it is important to remind that NTSC, PAL and SECAM are all
color encoding systems.  They are used in conjunction with older standards
for the base monochrome signals--the old standards that were used when all
the TV sets were still black &amp; white.

In other words, the first televisions standards, referenced with letters
(M/B/G/I/K/etc.), were used to broadcast pure monochrome, black &amp; white
images.  The NTSC, PAL and SECAM standards were then introduced to add a
specific color signal to colorize this pure monochrome signal.

When the color was introduced, the idea was to remain compatible with the
existing old black &amp; white TV sets, so that these old black &amp; white TV sets
would still continue to be able to display the image (but in black &amp; white,
obviously).

In the television world, the black &amp; white image, also known as the
monochrome signal, is called the "luminance" ("Y" for short); whilst the
color information is called the "chrominance" ("C" for short).

For every dot defining the image, the "luminance" states how intense
(ranging from pure black to pure white) the dot is.  For every dot defining
the image, the "chrominance" states what is the color of the dot (within
the limit of the color palette that the color standard allows).

In the Atari 8-Bit world, the "luminance" notion can be understood if you
use the standard Graphics mode 9: you have just one color at your disposal
(say, white), and all you can do is draw graphics using 16 intensities of
white (ranging from pure black to pure white).  And the "chrominance" notion
can be understood if you use the standard Graphics mode 11: you have 16
colors at your disposal, but they all have the same intensity.  You control
the color, but not the brightness of the color.

To display a black &amp; white image, the "luminance" ("Y") signal is enough.
To display a color image, the "luminance" ("Y") and the "chrominance"
("C") signals are needed.  When a black &amp; white TV set receives a color
signal, it uses the "Y" signal as usual and remains unaware of the existence
of the "C" signal.  When a color TV set receives the same color signal, it
processes both "Y" &amp; "C".

In practice, the chrominance ("C") is transmitted with two separate
signals, "U" and "V".  Now you probably recognize the familiar "YUV" acronym
you've surely seen in discussions related to TV signals.

To simplify, PAL &amp; SECAM signals are quite similar, except that they use a
different way to transmit the "U" &amp; "V" signals ("chrominance").  PAL
transmits "U" &amp; "V" together, then the same "U" &amp; "V" information again but
slightly differently, to increase the accuracy.  SECAM transmits "U" then
"V".

The way that PAL vs. SECAM handle color is thus very different but since the
black &amp; white TV standards were quite similar across Europe (625 lines / 50
Hz), a PAL TV set is very likely to be able to display a SECAM video signal
(and the other way around), but in black &amp; white (because it can decode "Y"
but not "U" nor "V").  
 
The situation is totally different with NTSC vs. PAL.  Although they are very
similar in the way they handle color, they are based on totally different
black &amp; white TV standards (625 lines/50Hz for PAL, 525 lines/60Hz for
NTSC).  You have to remember that, by design, the 50Hz &amp; 60Hz display refresh
frequencies were based on the mains (household electric power supply)
frequencies: 120V 60Hz in USA and 220V-240V 50Hz in Europe.  Up to the mid-80s,
devices that were able to handle both 50Hz &amp; 60Hz video signals were very
expensive.

Nowadays (2009), almost any PAL TV set is able to display a 60Hz NTSC video
signal.

While it is often enough to distinguish between NTSC/PAL/SECAM, in practice
each color encoding system has been combined with multiple earlier monochrome
broadcast standards.  Thus, to fully specify the broadcast signal standard
used in any given country, both color system and base monochrome system is
indicated.  Common examples: NTSC M, PAL B/G, SECAM L.  A more complete list:

 NTSC M   : USA
 NTSC J   : Japan
  PAL B/G : Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Finland, Netherlands,
            Italy, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, Algeria, Turkey, 
            Ghana, India, Israel, New-Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Thailand,
            etc. 
  PAL I   : United Kingdom, Ireland, Hong Kong. 
  PAL D/K : Romania, China, Burundi, Cameroun, etc. 
  PAL M   : Brazil. 
  PAL N   : Argentina, Uruguay. 
SECAM L/L': France, Monaco 
SECAM B/G : Greece, Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, etc.
SECAM D/K : Bulgaria, C.E.I., DOM TOM, etc.

In France (Europe), in the early 80s, it was possible to buy "SECAM" devices
(TV set, VCR, etc...) or "PAL/SECAM" devices; the latter - being able to
process both SECAM and PAL signals - were more expensive.  For instance,
"PAL/SECAM" TV sets were popular among movies addicts (owning high end
equipment such as PAL LaserDisc players, etc) and for people living close to
a PAL-broadcasting country (at the Belgian border for instance, to receive
the PAL Belgian French-speaking programs).  Last but not least, some
companies did manufacture some PAL-to-RGB "video translators" devices, to
convert a PAL signal into a universal RGB signal, that most SECAM TV sets
were able to accept as video input.  These PAL-to-RGB "video translators"
were quite useful to display PAL signals (from various home computers,
including PAL Atari XL &amp; PAL Commodore 64) on SECAM TV sets.  The models
manufactured by "CGV" (the company still exists: <a href=http://www.cgv.fr/>http://www.cgv.fr/</a>) were very
popular and widely available in the computer shops. (actual pictures
available: <a href=http://www.atari800xl.eu/public/cgv-pvp80.zip>http://www.atari800xl.eu/public/cgv-pvp80.zip</a> )

Consequently, in 1984, Atari France was not afraid to distribute PAL 600XL
&amp; 800XL computers in a SECAM country (although it could increase the total
cost of the solution).  Indeed, it would have been dangerous to ignore this
market, where other US competitors were already present and successful
(Commodore 64, Apple II, etc).  The French owners of the PAL Atari XL
computers had two choices:
- Use a PAL/SECAM TV set
- Buy a PAL-to-RGB converter, and use a common SECAM TV set
A couple of months later (Q4, 1984), the SECAM Atari 800XL computers were
finally available.

It is worth noting that in the early 80s the Atari 400 and 800 models had
also both been officially distributed in France, but only the PAL models,
and only in specialized computers shops.  Consequently, they were more
difficult to acquire, very expensive and limited to wealthy amateurs.

=-=-=-=-=
Piotr Fusik writes (3/06):
   In Poland we had PAL Ataris, which was a problem in the time
   of SECAM.  You could connect a PAL Atari to a SECAM TV, but there was
   no color and (IIRC) no sound.  The solution was to buy an inexpensive
   converter mounted inside the TV, so the TV supported PAL in addition
   to SECAM.  This was quite popular, because the VCRs were PAL, too.

=-=-=-=-=
In some ways the specifications of the hardware in the 8-bit Atari computer
are closely linked to the specifications of the television signal standard
used in the market where the machine was designed to be used.  Thus there were
different versions of the Atari computers produced for different markets,
based on the TV standards used in those markets:

 NTSC versions: 400,800,1200XL,600XL,800XL,65XE,130XE,XEgs
PAL B versions: 400,800,600XL,800XL,65XE,130XE,XEgs,800XE
PAL I versions: 400,800,600XL,800XL,65XE,130XE,XEgs
SECAM versions: 800XL,130XE,XEgs

NTSC computers contain NTSC versions of the ANTIC and CTIA/GTIA chips;
PAL computers contain PAL versions of the ANTIC and GTIA chips;
SECAM computers contain a PAL version of the ANTIC chip, and the FGTIA chip.

=-=-=-=-=
So with all that out of the way...

What are the software compatibility issues surrounding all these different
NTSC/PAL-B/PAL-I/SECAM versions of the Atari 8-bit computers?

 -- PAL B and PAL I computers differ only in the TV channel frequencies used
by the RF signal produced.  So in terms of software compatibility, all PAL
Atari computers are indistinguishable.

 -- The FGTIA is designed to be 100% software compatible with the PAL GTIA.
This fact, along with the fact that SECAM computer models include a PAL ANTIC,
mean that the PAL and SECAM versions of the Atari computers are completely
software compatible, but with one practical exception: in GTIA Graphics Mode 1
(BASIC Graphics mode 9), while the GTIA can display 16 distinct luminances,
the FGTIA can only display 8 distinct luminances.

Thus the situation essentially simplifies down to just two sets of Atari
computers that may have potential software compatibility issues between them: 

NTSC computers vs. PAL/SECAM computers

=-=-=-=-=
What might happen if you run a software program designed with an NTSC Atari on
a PAL or SECAM Atari, or a program designed with a PAL or SECAM Atari on an
NTSC Atari?  There are a number of possibilities:

1) The program may run faster or slower than intended.

In order to work with the different timings of the NTSC and PAL/SECAM video
signal standards, components of the NTSC versions of the Atari computers run
at slightly different speeds than they due on PAL/SECAM Atari computers.

The CPU clock rate of the PAL/SECAM Atari computer is slightly slower than
that of the NTSC Atari:
       NTSC machines: 1.7897725MHz
  PAL/SECAM machines: 1.7734470MHz
Software timing that is based exclusively on the CPU clock rate would thus run
nearly 1% faster/slower on the opposite type of Atari.  This effect, while
small, can be significant in applications that are computation- or timing-
sensitive, such as music players, or in any programs designed to simulate real
time.

The screen refresh rate of the PAL/SECAM Atari computer is considerably slower
than that of the NTSC Atari:
       NTSC machines: 59.94Hz
  PAL/SECAM machines: 49.86Hz
Software that operates as a Vertical Blank Interrupt (VBI), that is, software
that is repeatedly executed during the times between screen frame refreshes,
is thus executed at considerably different frequencies on NTSC machines vs.
PAL/SECAM machines.  Based on this effect alone, a VBI programmed on an NTSC
machine would run 16.8% slower on PAL/SECAM machines.  Conversely, a VBI
programmed on a PAL/SECAM machine would run 20.2% faster on NTSC machines.
(59.94Hz-49.86Hz=10.08Hz ; 10.08Hz/59.94Hz=16.8% ; 10.08Hz/49.86Hz=20.2%)
These calculations ignore the above-mentioned CPU clock rate differences,
which would also come into play.

2) The program may exhibit some sort of "screen flickering" effect.

The ANTIC display list is the software program responsible for the video
display, horizontal scan line by horizontal scan line.  There are 262 lines
available in the (non-interlaced) NTSC video signal, while there are 312 lines
available in the (non-interlaced) PAL/SECAM video signal.  If software written
on a PAL/SECAM machine sets up an ANTIC display list that is made up of more
scan lines than are available in the NTSC video standard, the program will
exhibit a "screen flickering" effect if run on the NTSC Atari.

3) The system may crash.

NTSC and PAL/SECAM machines have different numbers of machine cycles available
for execution of software routines designed as vertical blank interrupts
(VBIs). 

An Immediate VBI must complete execution within the number of machine cycles
available during the vertical blank time:

  NTSC: 2508 machine cycles 
    (262 NTSC scanlines - 240 Atari scanlines) * 114 cycles/scanline
  PAL/SECAM: 8208 machine cycles
    (312 PAL/SECAM scanlines - 240 Atari scanlines) * 114 cycles/scanline

  8208 - 2508 = 5700
  PAL/SECAM machines have a total of 5700 more machine cycles available for
  Immediate VBIs than are available on NTSC machines.
  
A Deferred VBI must complete execution within the number of machine cycles
available from one vertical blank to the next.  The number of machine cycles
available for a Deferred VBI depends upon the ANTIC Display List in use, but 
the upper limit may be derived from the total number of machine cycles per
frame:
       NTSC: 29859 machine cycles / frame
  PAL/SECAM: 35568 machine cycles / frame

  35568 - 29859 = 5709
  PAL/SECAM machines could have as many as 5709 more machine cycles available
  for Deferred VBIs than are available on NTSC machines.

If there are not enough machine cycles available on an NTSC machine to execute
a VBI that was developed on a PAL/SECAM machine, the NTSC system will crash.

4) The colors displayed by the program are not what was intended.

When utilizing ANTIC graphics modes 2, 3, or 15, NTSC Atari computers exhibit
unique color artifacting effects that are not present on PAL/SECAM Atari
computers.  (Artifacting is discussed elsewhere in this FAQ list.)  As a
result, software that utilizes one of these high-resolution graphics modes can
appear to be using very different colors on NTSC machines in comparison to
PAL/SECAM machines.

Also, the additional color frequency generation circuitry present in PAL/SECAM
machines produces a color palette that is similar to, though different from,
the color palette of NTSC Atari computers.  These differences are subtle
enough that they are generally not problematic.

5) The program may explicitly refuse to run on incorrect hardware.

Software may be designed to determine whether the Atari is NTSC or PAL/SECAM,
and refuse to run if the hardware present does not match what is expected.

6) The program may not load correctly at all.

This would mostly likely result from copy protection techniques based upon
precise hardware timing associated with disk drives, cassette recorders, or
components of the computer itself, where the timing was not anticipated to
vary depending upon NTSC vs. PAL/SECAM hardware.

According to Jindroush (2/26/02), two examples of programs that run on NTSC
machines but not PAL/SECAM machines as a result of timing-based copy
protection techniques (probably based on vblank timing) are Transylvania and
The Quest, both by Penguin Software.

7) The program may run fine on both NTSC and PAL/SECAM machines.

Either the differences are too slight to matter, or the software may be
sophisticated enough to detect NTSC vs. PAL/SECAM hardware, as described
above, and act accordingly.

An example of a program that alters its behavior depending upon detection of
NTSC versus PAL/SECAM is Ghostbusters by Activision (checks the GTIA type).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=
How can software determine whether it is running on NTSC or PAL/SECAM
hardware?

Several techniques are available to programmers, as follows:

(1) The XL OS (not the 400/800 OS) provides a flag called PALNTS at decimal
memory location 98 (hex: $62).  PALNTS indicates whether the CTIA/GTIA/FGTIA
has reported itself to be NTSC or PAL/SECAM, where 0 means NTSC, or 1 means
PAL/SECAM.  In Atari BASIC, enter "? PEEK(98)" to determine the value of the
PALNTS flag.

(2) An approach which works on all 400/800/XL/XE systems is to use the same
method used by the XL OS to set the value of the PALNTS flag described above. 
That is, to read and interpret the "PAL" memory flag, decimal location 53268
(hex: $D014).  The value of PAL is provided by the CTIA/GTIA/FGTIA chip
itself.  Meanings are:
  Bit 1-3 clear (xxxx000x) = PAL/SECAM
  Bit 1-3 set   (xxxx111x) = NTSC
(Proper interpretation of the value returned by PEEK(53268) in Atari BASIC
would thus be a bit of a programming challenge.  This is left to the reader!)

(3) Software may determine NTSC or PAL/SECAM by determining how many scan
lines are being generated by ANTIC.  This is done by monitoring the VCOUNT
memory register.  VCOUNT (54283 decimal, $D40B hex) is used by ANTIC to keep
track of which line is currently being generated on the screen.  Values
reflect the line count divided by two.  VCOUNT values range from zero to 130
for an NTSC ANTIC (131*2=262 scan lines), while VCOUNT values range from zero
to 155 for a PAL ANTIC (156*2=312 scan lines).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Bottom line:

Software written for NTSC machines (North America) will (almost) always work
on PAL/SECAM machines (Europe), but software designed on PAL/SECAM machines
sometimes won't work as intended on NTSC machines.

Replacing the NTSC ANTIC chip in an NTSC Atari with a PAL ANTIC changes the
screen refresh rate to 50Hz, allowing most of the PAL/SECAM-only European
software to run on a North American NTSC Atari.  However, make sure your
display device can support a 50Hz PAL signal first!

North American Atari users might also obtain and use real European PAL or
SECAM Atari machines, with the same caveat concerning the display device.

  Some features of the proprietary Atari SIO bus:
      (some of this from the OS User's Manual, pp. 145-148)
      - The Atari computer has one SIO port (managed by POKEY).  
      - Most Atari-specific peripherals include 2 identical SIO ports.
      - Multiple SIO devices may be connected to the Atari via the SIO bus
        "daisy-chain" -- that is, a second SIO device is connected to one of
        the 2 identical SIO ports of the first SIO device, and the first SIO
        device is connected to the computer via its other SIO port.  Any Atari
        SIO device that only has one SIO port must be connected to the system
        at the end of the SIO daisy chain.
      - There are no pin reassignments made in the Serial bus cable, so pin 3,
        the computer's Data In line, is the peripheral's data output line; and
        similarly for pin 5.
      - Peripherals with 2 SIO ports allow all signals and power to pass
        through on the SIO bus, whether or not the peripheral is powered on.
      - The Atari OS supports asynchronous SIO communication at 19,200 baud
      - Data is transmitted and received as 8 bits of serial data preceded by
        a logic zero start bit and succeeded by a logic one stop bit.
      - All bus commands must originate from the computer;
        Peripherals will present data on the bus only when commanded to.
      - Every bus operation will go to completion before another bus operation
        is initiated (no overlap).
      - An error detected at any point in the command sequence will abort the
        entire sequence.
      - Three types of SIO bus protocol commands:
        1) Data send, 2) Data receive, 3) Immediate (no data -- command only)
      - The Atari OS does not utilize the lines: Clock Input, /Proceed, 
        /Interrupt

Subject: 2.1) What video display devices and speakers can I use with my Atari?

The Atari 8-bit computers produce a single video signal and monophonic audio.

The 400/800 models also produce some sounds (primarily the keyclick and system
buzzer sounds) by way of an internal speaker.

Most 8-bit Atari computers put out both their video and audio signals in two
places:

1) 400/800, Domestic(NTSC): Built-in coaxial cable with phono plug - male
   400/800, PAL/UK: Built-in coaxial cable with Belling-Lee plug - male
   XL/XE, Domestic/PAL/UK: Switch Box / Television jack (phono jack - female)

Provides an analog Radio-Frequency (RF) television signal (video and audio).

The Atari's RF signal may be used on a television that:
 - Supports use of an external RF antenna (normally for receiving TV
   broadcasts over the air)
 - Can decode an analog television signal (NTSC or PAL, matching the version
   of the computer)
 - Has a tuner that can additionally tune to the necessary TV channel(s) used
   by the Atari:
    - Domestic Atari computers (for NTSC television) use one of two
      television frequencies, selected with a physical switch located on the
      back (all but the 800) or side (800) of the computer:
       - 55.25MHz video/59.75MHz audio - TV Channel 2 in North America - or
       - 61.25MHz video/65.75MHz audio - TV Channel 3 in North America
    - UK Atari computers (for PAL I television) use:
       - 591.25MHz video/597.25MHz audio - TV Channel 36 in the UK
    - PAL Atari computers (for PAL B television) use:
       - 62.25MHz video/67.75MHz audio - TV Channel 4 in Germany

Domestic (NTSC) 400/800/XL/XE computers shipped with a TV Switch Box (CA010112
/ CA014746 packaged).  This includes a phono jack (female) for RF signal input
from the Atari, input connector(s) for your TV/cable/satellite antenna, and
75-ohm and/or 300-ohm output connector(s) for connection to the antenna input
on the television.  (For optimal signal quality, a simple adapter (phono
socket - female to F connector plug - male) in place of the standard TV Switch
Box is preferable.)

Domestic (NTSC) XL/XE computers shipped with a coaxial RF Cable / TV Video
Cable (1200XL: CA061177 - 12 feet; other XL/XE: CA024624 toroid cable
Domestic/NTSC versions).  The input end is a phono plug (male) that plugs into
the Switch Box/Television jack on the computer; the output end is also a
phono plug (male).

PAL/UK XL/XE computers shipped with a coaxial RF Cable / TV Video Cable
(CA024624 Toroid Cable PAL versions).  The input end is a phono plug that
plugs into the Switch Box/Television jack on the computer; the output end is a
TV aerial plug (Belling-Lee plug - male).

While the display quality of the RF video signal may be adequate, the quality
of the video provided at the Atari's Monitor port is noticeably superior.

2) Monitor port

A 5-pin (NTSC/PAL) or 6-pin (SECAM) DIN Monitor port, which along with the
audio signal provides one or two video signals:

  a) Composite video 
      - NTSC, PAL, or SECAM encoding, depending on the computer version

  b) Y/C Video, also known as S-Video
      - Separate composite luminance (Y) and chrominance (C) signals
      - NTSC or PAL encoding, depending on the computer version
        (Not provided on SECAM computer versions)

The separate chrominance/luminance video signal is noticeably superior to both
the RF television output and the composite video output.

Monitor port exceptions among Atari computer models:
- The 400, NTSC 600XL, and XE game system lack the Monitor port.
- The SECAM 800XL, SECAM 130XE, and SECAM XE System Console have a different, 
  6-pin Monitor port that provides composite video but not separate 
  chrominance/luminance signals
- The XE System Console includes a phono Monitor Video Jack providing the
  composite video signal, and also a phono Monitor Audio Jack providing the
  audio signal.
- The 1200XL (all), PAL 600XL (all), and 800XL (all but very late production)
  lack the separate chrominance signal at the Monitor port, and the PAL 600XL
  also lacks the separate luminance signal at the Monitor port.

Any video display monitor that supports composite video input (this generally
includes modern televisions) should be able to display the Atari's composite
video signal.  Monitors with built-in speakers for audio support, and monitors
with support for separate chrominance/luminance video inputs, are preferred
for use with the Atari.

Commodore produced many monitors with separate chrominance and luminance
inputs, making them popular with Atari users.  Lonnie McClure provides this
list of suitable Commodore monitors:

  1701, 1702, 1802, CM-141, 1080, 2002, 1902, 1902A*, 1084**, 1084S**

  * The 1902A used a DIN connector for chrominance/luminance, which makes
  cabling a bit more of a problem.  The composite and audio connectors are
  standard phono jacks, however.

  ** The 1084 and 1084S had more than one version.  Some used the a DIN
  connector for chrominance/luminance connections, like the 1902A, while some
  used standard phono jacks.

  The 1902 and 1902A are very different in appearance.  The original 1902
  shares the same slightly rounded front case design as the 1080 and 2002,
  while the 1902A is has a rather square case design, and was manufactured
  by Magnavox (as were some of the 1084 and 1084S versions).

The pinout for the Atari Monitor port is in the pinouts section of this FAQ
list.

The typical Atari monitor cable includes the male 5-pin DIN connector on one
end, and two phono plugs on the other end.  One of the phono plugs will carry
the monophonic sound signal, and the other will carry the composite video
signal.  Atari's own CX89 Color Monitor Cable is of this type.

You may find an Atari monitor cable where the video signal carried on the
second phono plug is not the composite video signal, but is rather the
composite luminance signal.  These cables are for use with monochrome
composite video monitors (usually green or amber).  Atari's own CX82 Black
and White Monitor Cable is of this type.

The ideal Atari monitor cable includes 4 phono plugs at the output end,
carrying the sound signal, the composite video signal, the composite
luminance signal, and the composite chrominance signal.  Only the best
composite monitors include separate chrominance and luminance inputs.  When
the separate chrominance and luminance connectors are used, the composite
video connector is not used.

There is no real standard for colors for the different monitor cable
connectors.  It is safe to identify them by trial and error.

The separate composite chrominance and luminance signals that the Atari puts
out comprise what the world has since come to call Y/C video or S-video.
S-video connectors are normally Mini4.  It is possible to build a cable, or
purchase several adapters, that can allow you to utilize the separate Y/C
signals generated by the Atari with a television (or other display device)
that provides a standard S-video Mini4 input jack.  This is the ultimate
display option for the 8-bit Atari.  Clarence Dyson has a nice page about
such a project at: <a href=http://www.wolfpup.net/atarimods/svideo.html>http://www.wolfpup.net/atarimods/svideo.html</a>

A "video scaler" or "up-converter" is an adapter that will accept a lower-
resolution input video signal such as RF, composite video, or s-video, and
output a conversion of the signal as a standard, higher-resolution video
signal.  With such a device, the 8-bit Atari can be used with any modern
television or monitor.  Examples:

 - AV Toolbox manufactures several suitable adapters, listed at:
   <a href=http://www.avtoolbox.com/upconpage.shtml>http://www.avtoolbox.com/upconpage.shtml</a>

 - Ambery markets their "Ultra Video to VGA Converter", see:
   <a href=http://www.ambery.com/vitoxgacoscs.html>http://www.ambery.com/vitoxgacoscs.html</a>
   and other suitable, more expensive Video to VGA/RGBHV Converter Scalers:

   - Cheese Video Box from AV Toolbox
   - JAM!! from AIMS Lab

Some people report good results viewing the Atari computer's video signal
through a PC using a TV/video capture card.  Wikipedia's article about such
devices: <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_tuner_card>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_tuner_card</a>

SCART - an acronym for Syndicat des Constructeurs d'Appareils Radiorecepteurs
et Televiseurs - is a 21-pin universal connecting cable/socket system used for
audio/video components in Europe.  The cables transmit RGB, composite video,
S-Video, mono and stereo sound.  SCART, which is also known as PERITEL, EURO
AV BUS and EUROCONECTOR, is common throughout Europe, particularly in France,
England, Germany, Switzerland, and Scandinavia.  SCART is also very popular in
the Russian Audio Video market.  It is possible to interface the Atari's
composite video signal, along with the audio signal.  DGS sells such a cable,
see: <a href=http://www.dgs.clara.net/>http://www.dgs.clara.net/</a>

Two current sources for Atari monitor connectivity products:
  More Than Games produces "A8 A/V BOB", an audio/video breakout box featuring
  phono jacks for composite video, chrominance, luminance, and mono audio; it
  also features an s-video jack providing chrominance and luminance.

Subject: 2.2) What were the Atari XC1411 and XM128 monitors?

The Atari XC1411 monitor was shown at the January 1985 Winter Consumer
Electronics Show in Las Vegas.  It was a 14" color composite video monitor,
with built-in speaker, styled to match the Atari XE computers.  There were two
phono jacks, one for composite video and one for sound, and units were in the
same case as the original Goldstar-produced Atari SC1224 monitor for Atari ST
computers.  The XC1411 never shipped, and no more than a handful of prototype
units may exist.

The Atari XM128 monitor was shown at the January 1985 Winter Consumer
Electronics Show in Las Vegas.  It was a 12" green monochrome monitor, styled
to match the Atari XE computers, suitable for high-resolution 80-column text
display.  The XM128 never shipped, and no more than a handful of prototype
units may exist.

Subject: 2.3) What is artifacting?

The term TV artifacts refers to a spot or "pixel" on the screen that displays
a different color than the one assigned to it.  --De Re Atari, page D-1

There are two different types of artifacting associated with the Atari.

The first type is considerably more intuitive.  Color cathode ray tube (CRT)
televisions and computer displays generate color by exciting red, green, and
blue phosphors arranged in either an aperture grille pattern (vertical wires)
or a shadow mask pattern (triads of dots).
  <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture_grille>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture_grille</a>
  <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_mask>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_mask</a>
The density of the phosphors defines the "dot pitch" of the display device.
If a video signal source defines a spot or pixel that is smaller than the dot
pitch of the display device, then accurate color cannot be reproduced by that
display device in that precise spot on the screen.  This type of artifacting
is relatively minor with the Atari because of the relatively low resolution of
Atari graphics modes in comparison to the dot pitch of CRT display devices.

NTSC Atari computers exhibit a considerably more profound type of artifacting
than the above.  The following is from De Re Atari, Appendix D: 
"Television Artifacts": <a href=http://www.atariarchives.org/dere/chaptD.php>http://www.atariarchives.org/dere/chaptD.php</a>
Appendix D is credited to Atari's Lane Winner with assistance from Jim Cox.
=-=-=-=-=-=
This section discusses how to get multiple colors out of a single color
graphics mode through the use of television artifacts. 

The ANTIC modes with which this can be accomplished are 2, 3, and 15.  ANTIC
mode 2 corresponds to BASIC mode 0, ANTIC mode 15 is BASIC mode 8, and ANTIC
mode 3 has no corresponding BASIC mode.  Each of these modes has a pixel
resolution of one half color clock by one scan line.  They are generally
considered to have one color and two luminances.  With the use of artifacts,
pixels of four different colors can be displayed on the screen in each of
these modes. 

A simple example of artifacts using the Atari computer is shown by entering
the following lines: 
  GRAPHICS 8 
  COLOR 1 
  POKE 710,0 
  PLOT 60,60 
  PLOT 63,60

These statements will plot two points on a black background; however each
pixel will have a different color. 

To understand the cause of these differing colors one must first understand
that all the display information for the television display is contained in a
modulated television signal. 

The two major components of this signal are the luminance, or brightness, and
the color, or tint.  The luminance information is the primary signal,
containing not only the brightness data but also the horizontal and vertical
syncs and blanks.  The color signal contains the color information and is
combined or modulated into the luminance waveform. 

The luminance of a pixel on the screen is directly dependent on the amplitude
of the luminance signal at that point.  The higher the amplitude of the signal,
the brighter the pixel. 

The color information, however, is a phase shifted signal.  A phaseshifted
signal is a constantly oscillating waveform that has been delayed by some
amount of time relative to a reference signal, and this time delay is
translated into the color. 

The color signal oscillates at a constant rate of about 3.579MHz, thus
defining the highest horizontal color resolution of a television set.  This
appears on the screen in the form of 160 visible color cycles across one scan
line.  (There are actually 228 color cycles including the horizontal blank and
sync, and any overscan.) 

The term "color clock" refers to one color cycle and is the term generally
used throughout the Atari documentation to describe units of measurement
across the screen.  The graphics mode 7 is an example of one color clock
resolution, where each color clock pixel can be a different color.  (There are
microprocessor limitations though.) 

Atari also offers a "high resolution" mode (GRAPHICS 8) that displays 320
pixels across one line.  This is generated by varying the amplitude of the
luminance signal at about 7.16MHz, which is twice the color frequency. 

Since the two signals are theoretically independent, one should be able to
assign a "background" color to be displayed and then merely vary the luminance
on a pixel-by-pixel basis.  This in fact is the way mode 8 works, the
"background" color coming from playfield register 2, and the luminances coming
from both playfield registers 1 and 2. 

The problem is that in practice the color and luminance signals are not
independent.  They are part of a modulated signal that must be demodulated to
be used.  Since the luminance is the primary signal, whenever it changes, it
also forces a change in the color phase shift.  For one or more color clocks
of constant luminance this is no problem, since the color phase shift will be
unchanged in this area.  However, if the luminance changes on a half color
clock boundary it will force a fast color shift at that point.  Moreover, that
color cannot be altered from the transmitting end of the signal (the Atari
computer). 

Since the luminance can change on half color clock boundaries, this implies
that two false color, or artifact pixel types can be generated.  This is
basically true.  However, these two pixels can be combined to form two types
of full color clock pixels.  This is illustrated below:

  TV Scan     |                      |                     |

Note that each of these pixels requires one color clock of distance and
therefore has a horizontal resolution of 160. 

The colors A through D are different for each television set, usually because
the tint knob settings vary.  Thus they cannot be described as absolute colors,
for example, red; but they are definitely distinct from each other, and
programs have been written that utilize these colors.

=-=-=-=-=-=
The actual colors seen depends upon the tint setting of the NTSC display
device, and also upon the version of the NTSC Atari computer used, as pointed
out by Bryan on Oct 7, 08:

  It's well known that different models produce different artifact colors.
  The 800 produces Blue/Green, the 1200XL produces Green/Purple, and the other
  XLs produce Blue/Red.  The reason for this doesn't lie with GTIA, but
  rather with the delays inherent in the different video buffer circuits.
  When you start modifying the video circuits, you slightly alter the time
  alignment between chroma and luma and the artifact colors change.  The TV's
  decoder will be synched to the colorburst supplied by the chroma signal, but
  artifact colors are produced by changing the luma level at the 3.579 color
  frequency which the NTSC Atari models are inherently set up to do. 

A classic example of a game that utilizes color artifacting on the NTSC Atari
is the Broderbund game, Choplifter!.  2nd example: Drol, also by Broderbund.

Subject: 2.4) What is HDTV display lag?

Much software on the 8-bit Atari is highly interactive and timing-critical.
For example, many games are highly responsive to input from the game player
via a game controller (such as a joystick).  The Atari software programmer 
can reasonably assume that the video display device can reflect changes as
output by the Atari with no perceivable additional delay.  Software timing
considerations are normally limited to the capabilities and constraints of
the Atari hardware itself.

However, in some cases a television or video monitor may introduce a
noticeable lag time between the video signal as input by the Atari, and the
video signal as actually displayed by the device.  While any such effect is
truly negligible with CRT televisions or monitors (the standard of the time of
the Atari), the modern high-definition television (HDTV) has emerged as an
important exception.  An HDTV typically dedicates considerable processing
efforts (hardware+software) toward presenting the most attractive picture
possible.  Since few HDTV applications require precise interactive timing,
this video processing is generally not optimized for time efficiency.  When
used with an older but timing-precise device such as an 8-bit Atari computer,
the resulting delay can be quite noticeable, making the HDTV essentially
unusable for "serious" action gaming.

Fortunately, many HDTVs offer a "game mode" that circumvents much of the video
processing otherwise performed, thereby eliminating most of the display lag
otherwise introduced by the television.  If an HDTV is to be used with the
Atari for gaming, a "game mode" on the HDTV is essential.

Subject: 3.1.1) What are the Atari 410, 1010, XC11, &amp; XC12 Program Recorders?

An Atari Program Recorder resembles an ordinary audio cassette tape player,
providing secondary (not directly accessible by the computer's central
processing unit) and offline (removable from the computer) magnetic storage
and retrieval of digital data, using a standard compact cassette.  In addition
to the digital track, the program recorder can also play back an audio track,
allowing the computer user to both run programs and listen to voice or music. 
A single program recorder is used with a single Atari 8-bit computer.  Under
the Atari Operating System, the digital storage capacity of a 60-minute
cassette is about 102,400 bytes.  The Atari OS writes to the program recorder
at 600 bit/s.  

Specifications common to all Atari program recorders:
  - Tape structure is standard 1/4 track stereo format:
     - 4 tracks, divided into 2 channels/sides ("Side A" and "Side B")
     - Each tape channel/side is stereo, consisting of 2 tracks:
        - Left / Audio
        - Right / Digital
  - Automatic/software motor control: the computer can control tape motion 
    start/stop (both play and record functions), if the recorder PLAY button
    has already been pressed by the user.
  - Tape speed: 1.875 IPS (inches per second)
  - 3-digit tape counter
  - Audio track plays through television/monitor speaker
  - Preset volume levels (both playback and recording)
  - Media used is Philips Compact Cassette or equivalent
    (Atari CX4100 blank cassette tapes never shipped.)
  - Cassettes can play/record on both sides -- Cassette must be removed,
    flipped-over, and re-inserted to access the reverse channel/side of the 
    tape.
  - Cassette write protect notch status is respected: Will not write to a
    cassette side missing the write protect notch corresponding to that side
    of the cassette.
  - The cassette utilization/filesystem is controlled entirely by software,
    normally the C: Cassette Handler of the Atari Operating System.
    Specifications are provided elsewhere in this FAQ list.

Subject: 3.2.1) What is the Atari 810 Disk Drive?

The Atari 810 is a floppy disk drive that provides secondary (not directly
accessible by the computer's central processing unit) and offline (removable
from the computer) magnetic storage and retrieval of digital data, using a
standard (of its time) 5.25 inch diskette.  Diskette storage capacity is
90KiB.  The 810 Disk Drive is used with a single Atari 8-bit computer with a
minimum of 16KiB of RAM installed.  Up to four 810 disk drives may be attached
and used with an Atari computer at the same time.

The front of the 810 features a Power on/off switch, a "Power" indicator
light, and a "Disk busy" indicator light.  The rear of the unit includes two
SIO ports ("I/O Connectors"), a power input jack, and drive number selector
switches:

810 Functional Specifications
- Disk Rotation Speed: 288 RPM (Revolutions Per Minute) +- 1%
- Recording Density: 2,938 BPI (Bits Per Inch) (maximum)
- Flux Density: 5,876 FCI (Flux Changes per Inch) (maximum)
- Track density: 48 TPI (Tracks Per Inch)
- Tracks: 40
- Encoding method: FM (frequency modulation / "single density")
- Drive heads: One
- Media used is Atari CX8100 Blank Diskette or equivalent:
   - 5.25" micro-diskette / minidiskette / mini-disk / minifloppy diskette /
     mini-floppy diskette / floppy disk
   - Soft-sectored (no sector holes; one index hole, which the 810 ignores)
   - 48 TPI / "single density" / "double density" (any of these terms)
   - 40 tracks (avoid rare early 35 track disks from the 1970s)
   - Single-sided or Double-sided
      - The 810 is a single-sided drive, using the lower disk surface only.  
        However, the reverse side of a 2-sided "flippy" disk may be used by
        inserting the disk into the drive upside-down.
   - Media first used by the Wangco Model 82 Micro-Floppy Disk Drive (1977)
   NOTES:
      - 96 TPI 80-track "High Density" (HD) 1200KiB 5.25" floppy diskettes, 
        which are very common, can NOT be used with Atari 810 and compatible
        drives.  The media is physically different from 48 TPI diskettes.
      - 96 TPI 80-track "double-density" / "quad density" 720KiB 5.25" floppy 
        diskettes, which are rare, MAY be used with Atari 810 and compatibles.
        The media in these is actually identical to that of 48 TPI diskettes.
- Diskette write enable notch status is respected: will not write to diskette
  side lacking (or having a covered) write enable notch corresponding to that
  side of the disk.
- On the Atari, an empty floppy disk drive is powered on prior to inserting a
  diskette into the drive.  Conversely, the diskette is removed from the drive
  before the drive is turned off.  These procedures protect the integrity of
  data on diskettes.

The 810 underwent several significant design revisions over the course of its
manufacture.

Original 810 Disk Drive (1980-1981, no Data Separator and "Pre-Analog")
specifications:
- Micro Peripherals, Inc. (MPI) minifloppy diskette drive mechanism
- Two printed circuit boards: a Side Board and a Rear Board
- Power Input: 9 volts AC, 1.7 amperes
- Power Usage: 20-21 watts
- Power: Used with an external 9 volt AC transformer power supply:
  Atari CA014748 or equivalent (earlier 20W C014319 units only; later 18.5W
  C014319 units are inadequate)

810 drives manufactured after September 1, 1981 ("DS" sticker) shipped with an
External Data Separator Board, which enhances the ability of the FD1771 FDC to
process data.  It is installed in the Side Board where the FDC chip would
otherwise be installed. (810 FSM p.1-9)  The Side Board stepper motor circuit
voltage was increased to regulated 12 volts DC as well, leading to greater
power requirements for the drive:
  - Power Input: 9 volts AC, 3 amperes
  - Power Usage: 30 watts
  - Power: Used with an external 9 volt AC transformer power supply:
    Atari C016804 or equivalent
The External Data Separator Board was also offered as an upgrade for earlier
810 drives.  Earlier Side Boards must be upgraded in order to accept the Data 
Separator.

Next, Atari introduced the 810 Revision C ROM in November 1981 ("C" sticker). 
According to Antic (Oct. 82), "ROM C causes diskettes to be formatted with an
improved sector layout which is more efficient than that used by earlier 810
control ROMs."  Performance was reported to be 20% faster than with the
original B ROM.  The ROM C was also offered as an upgrade for older drives.

810 drives produced from about spring 1982 used the new "810 Analog"
("810M Analog") design: (810 FSM p.8B-1)
  1. A Power Supply Board now bolts onto the common base plate where the Rear
     Board used to be.  The Power Supply Board contains: 
      a) A redesigned Power Supply. 
      b) A Tachometer/Speed Switch I.C. (frequency to voltage converter)
         added as the Tach circuit to stabilize the motor speed.  
  2. An Analog Board now bolts to the top of the Drive Mechanism.  This board
     contains the Analog circuitry which used to be on the Rear Board.  The
     major changes are to the Read/Write circuitry.  The Analog Board
     contains: 
      a) Operational amplifiers ("op-amps") and discrete transistors in place
         of transistor arrays. 
      b) A multiplexor chip for switching the Read/Write amplifiers. 
  3. A 10 pin flat cable connects the Analog Board to the Power Supply Board.
810 Analog power: Used with an external 9 volt AC transformer power supply 
  rated for at least 30 watts; shipped with Atari CA017964.
The 3 new 810 Analog components were also offered together as an upgrade:
  - CB101128 "Grass Valley Analog Board Set" for Pre-Analog 810 drives.

In November 1982, the drive mechanism of the 810 Analog disk drive was changed
from MPI to Tandon.  The Tandon version is known as the "810T Analog" disk
drive.

Subject: 3.2.2) What is the Atari 1050 Disk Drive?

Portions of this section developed by Laurent Delsarte from the 1050 Field
Service Manual.

The Atari 1050 disk drive was introduced in June 1983 as a replacement for
the 810 disk drive.  The 1050 is fully backward compatible with the 810, with
the addition of a new "double density" mode of operation offering 130KiB of
data storage per diskette.  The "double density" mode works with a standard
(of its time) 5.25 inch soft-sectored diskette ("floppy disk") which is
certified for double density (Modified Frequency Modulation encoding method)
use. 

While Atari called the new 1050 mode "double density", the 1050 is not capable
of the 180KiB double density standard offered in many third party Atari disk
drives.  Thus, the 1050's "double density" is usually referred to as "enhanced
density" or "dual density."

Like the 810, the 1050 drive has only one drive head, so it can only read/
write to one side of the disk.  The reverse side of a 2-sided "flippy" disk
may be used by inserting the disk into the drive upside-down.

The front of the 1050 features a Power on/off switch, a Power indicator
light, and a "Disk busy" indicator light.  The rear of the unit includes two
SIO ports ("I/O Connectors"), a Power In jack, and Drive Select switches:
                     Black &amp; White left: Drive 1
                Black right, White left: Drive 2
                    Black &amp; White right: Drive 3
                Black left, White right: Drive 4

The 1050 drive features a horizontal slot with latch bar door mechanism.
To complete the insertion of a disk, turn the latch bar clockwise ninety
degrees.  To release the disk, turn the latch counterclockwise.

There were two production versions of the 1050 drive, designed to appear and
function identically.  The earlier 1050 made in Singapore for Atari, Inc. uses
a Tandon drive mechanism, while the later 1050 made in Hong Kong for Atari,
Corp. uses a World Storage drive mechanism.

The 1050 disk drive is used with an external 9 volt AC transformer power
supply rated for at least 50 watts; shipped with Atari CA017964.

The 1050 drive shipped with DOS 2.0S (1983), DOS 3 (1984), or DOS 2.5 (1985-
1987).

Subject: 3.2.3) What is the Atari XF551 Disk Drive?

The Atari XF551 disk drive was introduced in June 1987 as a replacement for
the 1050 disk drive.  The XF551 is fully backward compatible with the 1050,
with the addition of two new modes of operation: a true "double density" mode
offering 180KiB of data storage per (single-sided) diskette (fully compatible
with 3rd party double density drives for the Atari), and a "double-sided
double density" mode offering 360KiB of data storage per (2-sided) diskette.

Unlike the 810 or 1050, the XF551 drive has two drive heads, so it can
read/write to both sides of a 2-sided floppy disk (in double-sided double
density 360KiB disk mode).  The 360KiB mode of the XF551 writes "backwards" to
the second side of the disk in comparison to the way data would be stored on
the reverse side of a two-sided "flippy" disk in single-sided double density
180KiB mode.

When working with double-sided double density 360KiB disks, the XF551 is also
capable of communicating with the computer at about twice data rate of the
earlier Atari 1050 or 810 drives.  This XF551 high speed mode is supported by:
DOS XE, SpartaDOS X, XDOS, MyPicoDos, Micro-SpartaDOS, SuperDOS, Turbo-DOS,
BW-DOS.  A patch was also developed for SpartaDOS 3.2d.

The front of the XF551 features a "Disk busy" indicator light.  (Notably,
there is no power indicator light on the XF551.)  The rear of the unit
includes a power on/off switch, a Power jack, two SIO ("Peripheral") ports,
and Drive Select DIP switches:
                      Left &amp; Right down: Drive 1
                    Left down, Right up: Drive 2
                    Left up, Right down: Drive 3
                        Left &amp; Right up: Drive 4

More features/specifications of the XF551 disk drive:
- 8040/8050 MPU.  One of:
      - Intel 8050 microcontroller (MCU) @ 8.3333MHz, C070235
      - Intel 8040 microcontroller (MCU) @ 8.3333MHz, CB101393
   - The 8050 has internal ROM space that is not used in the XF551.
   - (Initial Atari and media reports incorrectly indicated a 6507 MPU.)
   - (The DOS XE: XF551 manual incorrectly indicates 18.3333MHz.)
- Western Digital WD1772 Floppy Disk Controller (FDC) C026028
   - Late production units substituted: Western Digital WD1770
- SIO Data rate (normal): 19,040 bit/s (NTSC), 18,688 bit/s (PAL)
            (high speed): 38,908 bit/s (NTSC), 38,553 bit/s (PAL)
   - High speed available in DS/DD 360KiB mode operation only
- Rotation rate: 300 RPM
  Virtually all other Atari-specific drives spin at 288 RPM.  This results in
  rare compatibility issues.  Specifically, these commercial disks do not load
  in, and can possibly be damaged (!) by the XF551:
      - Flight Simulator II (subLOGIC)
      - Blue Max (Synapse) (I have personally destroyed multiple Blue Max
        disks with the XF551 drive!  -mc)
      - Bank Street Writer (Broderbund).  Conflicting reports about this one.
      - Boulder Dash II (Databyte release?)
      - Inside (Spektra, 1990?--original Polish version?)
- Media used is the same as for the Atari 810.

The XF551 drive features a horizontal slot with latch bar door mechanism.
To complete the insertion of a disk, turn the latch bar clockwise ninety
degrees.  To release the disk, turn the latch counterclockwise.

XF551 drives were manufactured for Atari in two versions, both made in Japan.
- Mitsumi XF551 (earlier/common production)
   - Disk Busy light is rectangular, and is located below the drive latch.
   - "Straight" drive latch
   - See: <a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4052/4669794021_de721aa12d_b.jpg>http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4052/4669794021_de721aa12d_b.jpg</a>
   - When the drive latch is opened, an inserted disk stays in place until 
     removed manually.  
   - Inserting a disk does not cause any drive activity.
   - Like the Atari 810 and 1050, the Mitsumi XF551 ignores the index hole of
     a soft-sectored diskette when reading/writing, so the Mitsumi XF551 CAN
     read from, and write to, the flip side of a 2-sided disk in single-sided
     (90KiB, 130KiB, or 180KiB) mode if the disk lacks a 2nd jacket index hole
     corresponding to the reverse side of the disk.
- Chinon XF551 (later/uncommon production)
   - Disk Busy light is round, and is located directly to the left of the
     drive latch.  
   - "Non-straight" drive-latch
   - <a href=http://www.atarimax.com/jindroush.atari.org/data/hardpics/xf551__f.jpg>http://www.atarimax.com/jindroush.atari.org/data/hardpics/xf551__f.jpg</a>
   - Opening the drive latch causes an inserted disk to be ejected.
   - When a disk is inserted, the drive motor briefly spins and the Disk Busy
     light flashes accordingly.
   - Unlike the Atari 810 and 1050, the Chinon XF551 utilizes the index hole
     of a soft-sectored diskette when reading/writing, so the Chinon XF551
     CANNOT read from, nor write to, the flip side of a 2-sided disk in
     single-sided (90KiB, 130KiB, or 180KiB) mode if the disk lacks a 2nd
     jacket index hole corresponding to the reverse side of the disk.

Unlike the Atari 810 and 1050, the XF551 (both Mitsumi and Chinon) utilizes
the index hole of a soft-sectored diskette when formatting the disk.  As a
result, the XF551 CANNOT format the flip side of a 2-sided disk in single-
sided (90KiB, 130KiB, or 180KiB) mode if the disk lacks a 2nd jacket index
hole corresponding to the reverse side of the disk.

The XF551 disk drive is used with an external 9 volt AC transformer power
supply rated for at least 50 watts; shipped with Atari CA017964.

The XF551 shipped with DOS 2.5 (1987-1988) or DOS XE (from 1989).

Subject: 3.2.4) What were the Atari 815, XF521, and XF351 Disk Drives?

The 815 Dual Disk Drive was introduced by Atari in June 1980 at the Summer
Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Chicago.  The unit would feature two
single-sided, double density (MFM encoding) disk drives.  The 815 drives would
not have a single density (810-compatible) operation mode.
- Total storage capacity per diskette:
    40 tracks  x  18 sectors/track  =  720 sectors/disk
    720 sectors  x  256 bytes/sector  =  184,320 bytes/disk  (180KiB)
- While most 815 sample drives utilized the same Tandon drive mechanism found
  in late-production Atari 810 drives, there were also 815 sample drives built
  that used the MPI drive mechanism found in earlier 810 drives (including all
  810 drives manufactured while the 815 was under development).
- Manual: Atari 815 Operator's Manual C016377 (CO16377)
- The 815 disk drive has a built-in power supply (plugs directly into the 
  wall, 120V AC).
- 815 accessories from Atari:
   o CX8201 Master Diskette II
     (DOS II version 2.0D, or DOS 2.0D; version of DOS II supporting both 815
     and 810 disk drives; prototype box exists, but never shipped)
   o CX8202 5 Blank Diskettes
     Box contains five CX8202 Atari 810/815 Blank Diskettes (certified for
     double density use).
     Minimal production, see: <a href=http://www.myatari.com/ebay/815dt.html>http://www.myatari.com/ebay/815dt.html</a>
- Software titles announced by Atari to require the 815:
   o CX401 The Atari Accountant: General Accounting System (never shipped)
   o CX402 The Atari Accountant: Accounts Receivable System (never shipped)
   o CX403 The Atari Accountant: Inventory Control System (never shipped)

   o CX408 Atari Word Processor (Atari 815 Version; never shipped)
- Atari continued to promote the 815 through the summer of 1981 (see Company
  Store price list for 8-24-81 for a late reference); it was dropped from
  the product line by 1982.  Prototype units exist (according to 
  Atarimuseum.com: 60 units were produced), but the 815 never shipped.

The XF521 5.25" disk drive was previewed by Atari in January 1985 at the
Winter CES in Las Vegas.  The XF521 was to be a 130KiB, XE-styled, feature-
equivalent, and gradual replacement for the Atari 1050.  The XF521 never
shipped, and no more than a handful of prototype units may exist.

The XF351 3.5" single-sided double density disk drive was first previewed by
Atari in March 1986 at CeBIT in Hanover, West Germany.  The XF351 was
subsequently previewed at the 1986 Spring COMDEX show in Atlanta and at the
January 1987 Winter CES in Las Vegas.  With ADOS (would ship as: DOS XE), the
XF351 was reported to provide 325KiB (6/1986 report) or 320KiB (9/1986 report)
of storage (formatted) per disk.  The XF351 never shipped, and no more than a
handful of prototype units exist.

Subject: 3.2.5) What other floppy disk drives were designed for my Atari?

Major contributors to this section: Glenn M. Saunders, Tomasz M. Tatar,
James Bradford, Konrad M. Kokoszkiewicz, Don Schoengarth, Andreas
Koch, TXG/MNX

This section attempts to comprehensively list released 3rd-party floppy disk
drives designed for use with the Atari.  These attach to the computer via SIO
and generally include two Atari SIO ports, unless stated otherwise.  Top
transfer rate is 19.2 kbit/s unless stated otherwise.  Media requirements,
unless stated otherwise, are the same as for the Atari 810.

LEGEND
======
    SD = Single Density, 5.25" floppy disks, 90KiB/side, 810 compatible
    ED = Enhanced Density, 5.25" floppy disks, 130KiB/side, 1050 compatible
    DD = Double Density, 5.25" floppy disks, 180KiB/side, Percom compatible
    SS = Single-Sided 
         Drive has only one drive head, so it can only read/write to one side
         of the disk.  The reverse side of a 2-sided "flippy" disk may be used
         by inserting the disk upside-down.
    DS = Double-Sided 
         The following information is mostly taken from the documentation for 
         HiassofT's WriteAtr program, <a href=http://www.horus.com/~hias/atari/>http://www.horus.com/~hias/atari/</a>
         Double-Sided drives for the Atari may use one of three different 
         drive-mapping possibilities.
           * Most double-sided Atari disk drives:
             First fill tracks 0-39 (or 0-79) on the first side, then switch
             over to side 2 and again fill tracks 0-39 (0-79 for 3.5" disks).
           * The XF551 first fills track 0 on the first side.  Then it
             fills track 1, then track 2, ... up to track 39 (on a 5.25" disk)
             or 79 (on a 3.5" disk).  Then it switches to side 2 and fills
             the disk in reverse order (starting at track 39/79, then 38/78,
             ... til it has reached the end of the disk at track 0).
           * The third possibility is the standard in the PC world, but on the
             Atari it's possibly unique to drives connected via the Karin Maxi
             interface.
             If your Atari disk drive uses this mapping, it first fills
             track 0 on side 1, then track 0 on side 2, then seeks to track 1,
             again first fills track 1 / side 1, then track 1 / side 2,
             and so on, until it finishes with track 39 (79) / side 2.
             The drive switches the heads (sides) first before switching
             the track.
           * The TRAK AT-D4 (uniquely?) functions as two logical drives, where
             the second "drive" (side) is read/written in reverse order.

Subject: 3.2.6) What is the Percom configuration block?

The following is largely verbatim from Bill Wilkinson's "Insight: Atari"
column, Compute! magazine #65, October 1985, page 110-111.  See:
<a href=http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue65/insight_atari.php>http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue65/insight_atari.php</a>

As defined by the Percom standard (Percom was the first manufacturer of
double density disk drives for the Atari), a config block is a set of 12 bytes
within the memory of the disk control microprocessor--which is inside your
disk drive(s).  You read a drive's config block by passing "N" to it as an SIO
command.  You can write a new config block to a drive via an "O" command.  The
"N" and "O" commands closely parallel the "R" and "W" sector input/output
commands, except the data length is always 12 bytes and, no sector number is
needed.  The 12 bytes in the block are shown in the table:

   Byte #  # of   Description
           Bytes  
     0       1    Number of Tracks
     1       1    Step Rate (values have no universal meaning)
    2-3      2    Sectors per Track (byte 2 is high byte; byte 3 is low byte)
     4       1    Number of Sides or Heads (0=one head, 1=two heads)
     5       1    Density (0=FM/Single, 4=MFM/Double)
    6-7      2    Bytes per Sector (byte 6 is high byte; byte 7 is low byte)
     8       1    Drive Selected?
     9       1    Serial Rate Control (values have no universal meaning)
   10-11     2    Miscellaneous (reserved)

While the successful establishment of the Percom standard allowed for
interchangeable double density (and greater) disk drives for the Atari, the
extent of support for the full standard varies widely among particular disk
drives.  Atari's own 810 and 1050 drives do not support the Percom config
block at all, but most 3rd party disk drives designed for the Atari support at
least portions of the Percom standard.  For example, the Indus GT supports
Percom config block bytes 5-7 (Density and Bytes/Sector) only.

------------------------------

Subject: 3.2.7) How can I use an industry standard floppy disk drive?

The standard interface between floppy disk drive (FDD) and controller was
established by the Shugart Associates SA400 minifloppy Disk Drive (1976).  The
interface normally consists of a 34 conductor ribbon cable, using 34 pin PCB
edge connectors (5.25" drive convention) and/or 34 pin header (2x17)
connectors (3.5" drive convention).

(Earlier 8" floppy disk drives normally used a 50 conductor ribbon cable and
corresponding pin header or PCB edge connectors.)

This section should list all devices for the Atari computer that provide a
standard FDD interface for the system, allowing the addition of one or more
standard 5.25" or 3.5" floppy disk drives.

Unless stated otherwise, these FDD interfaces support single or double density
drives, but not high density 1440KiB 3.5" or 1200KiB 5.25" drives.

Atari disk drives that also add a standard FDD interface
--------------------------------------------------------
- Amdek: AMDC-II                          (34 pin header)
- Micro MainFrame MF-1682                 (PCB edge)
   - 'Supports both 5.25" and 8" drives'
- Percom: RFD40-S1, AT88-S1PD, AT88-SPD   (34 pin header)
          RFD40-S2, AT88-S1               (34 pin PCB edge)
          RFD44-S1, RFD44-S2, AT88-S2
   - Matching add-on drives:
          Percom RFD40-A1      SS SD/DD
          Percom AT88-A1       SS SD
- Trak: AT-1, AT-D1, AT-D2, AT-D4         (34 pin PCB edge)
   - Matching add-on drive:
          Trak AT-S1           SS SD/DD

Subject: 3.3.1) What is the Corvus disk system?

For mass storage capacity beyond that of floppy disk drives, microcomputer
users of the time of the Atari could turn to drives that utilized a "fixed" or
"sealed" magnetic disk.  Such devices were still widely known in the early
1980s as "Winchester" disks, after the code name for IBM's influential 3340
Direct Access Storage Facility (14"; 70MB or 140MB) introduced back in 1973.
As they became much more common by the mid 1980s, the Winchester term mostly
disappeared from common usage, along with the alternatives "fixed-disk" and
"sealed disk", all ultimately replaced by today's: "hard disk drive"

One feature of early hard disk drives was that the disk controller was usually
a separate component from the disk itself.  In the late 1970s and early 1980s
several different interface standards for communications between computer
host, controller, and disk competed for market acceptance.  This complicated
market landscape, combine with the extreme costs involved, severely limited
the sales of hard disks for home computers.

Corvus Systems teamed with disk-maker International Memories Inc. (IMI) to
develop and market complete, integrated Winchester disk systems compatible
with many computer platforms, including the Atari 800.  It was the first and
remained the only hard disk drive solution available for an Atari computer for
several years.

Corvus Systems Atari 800 Disk System (1982) includes:
   - Corvus Winchester Disk Drive unit, one of:
      - Corvus B-Series 5.25" 6MB
        (IMI 5007 disk with IMI 5000 Phase III controller)
      - Corvus B-Series 8" 11MB
        (IMI 7710 disk with embedded controller)
      - Corvus B-Series 8" 20MB
        (IMI 7720 disk with embedded controller)
      - Corvus H-Series 5.25" 6MB (Model 6)
        (IMI 5006H disk with IMI 5000H controller)
      - Corvus H-Series 5.25" 12MB (Model 11)
        (IMI 5012H disk with IMI 5000H controller)
      - Corvus H-Series 5.25" 18MB (Model 20)
        (IMI 5018H disk with IMI 5000H controller)
   - Corvus Atari Interface (host adapter)
      - Attaches to Atari 800 controller jacks 3 and 4
      - Attaches to Processor port on Corvus drive (34 pin Corvus-IMI bus)
   - Two different "AT Utilities" diskettes (v.1 and v.2)
   - Disk System Installation Guide and System Manager's Guide
- The power switch is on the front of 8" drives, while it's on the back on
  5.25" drives.
- Drive units can be daisy-chained.  The Processor port of an add-on drive can
  be connected to the Drive port of an existing drive (34 pin Corvus-IMI bus).
  Up to 4 Corvus hard drives (any of the above models) can be connected to one
  computer.
- Requires 48KiB RAM, and 810 or equivalent floppy disk drive.
- SYSGEN utility divides the drive into any combination of 90KiB and 180KiB
  "volumes" for use by the Atari as logical drives.  A Model 20 drive may 
  contain up to 196 single-sized volumes (with no double-sized volumes) or up
  to 98 double-sized volumes (with no single-sized volumes).
- System must boot using Corvus bootstrap from either disk or cassette.
   - WRITEBOOT.OBJ utility creates a Corvus Boot Disk out of Atari DOS 2.0S,
     which boots to: Disk Operating System II Corvus A2.0D (4/25/81)
   - CWRTBOOT.OBJ utility creates a boot cassette
- Multiple users support - each "user" can have access to up to 8 logical
  drives, which can be any combination of Corvus volumes or Atari drives
  (except logical drive 1 must be Corvus volume 1 or an Atari drive where a
  Corvus boot disk will be used).
   - Usage: User boots the system with uniquely-assigned boot disk, then uses
     the DOS L. BINARY LOAD option to load the user's unique "volume mount
     table" file, which maps the user's assigned Corvus volumes to logical
     drives.
- Optional: Corvus Mirror (internal)
   - Mirror video in and video out phono jacks connect to corresponding jacks
     on a VCR (VHS or Beta)
   - Corvus volumes or the entire Corvus drive can be backed-up or restored
     from backup.
- Sold separately by Corvus:
   - Corvus Multiplexer - Configured as a Host, unit connects to the Processor
     port of a Corvus drive and provides 8 Processor ports (34 pin Corvus-IMI
     bus) to the system, allowing up to 8 computers to be connected to the
     system.  Configured as a Master, unit allows Multiplexer Host units to be
     attached to the 8 Processor ports of the Master unit.  Thus up to 64
     computers can share the same Corvus hard drive (or set of up to 4 daisy-
     chained Corvus hard drives).
     (System upper limit: 80MB of storage shared by 64 computers)
   - Corvus Mirror (external unit) - Same as internal Mirror, but is connected
     between the Corvus drive and the Atari Interface, or between a Corvus 
     drive and a Corvus Multiplexer. (34 pin Corvus-IMI bus)
- Sold separately by ?????: Right Cartridge which boots the Atari from the 
  Corvus.  (Details????)
- Sold separately by ADS: Integrater with smallDOS (1983)
   - Produced by ADS; software &amp; hardware design by D.S.S.A. (David &amp; Sandy
     Small and Associates); sales support by Adams Computer Systems, Inc. 
   - Replaces the Atari CX801 ROM Personality Module
   - Makes Corvus volumes appear to any Atari DOS as standard floppy drives
   - Boot from Corvus volumes
   - Replacement Mount program; new Mount Table Editor

Subject: 3.3.2) How can I use an ST506 interface hard disk (MFM or RLL)?

The 5MB ST-506 MicroWinchester was the first 5.25" hard disk drive, introduced
in 1980 as the first product from Shugart Technology (shortly to be renamed,
Seagate Technology).  The market success of the ST-506 (along with the
subsequent 10MB ST-412 and 20MB ST-225) led to the ST506 interface between
disk controller and drive (an incremental derivation from the interface for
the 8" 10MB Shugart Associates SA1000 hard disk from 1979) being established
as an industry standard for hard disk drives.

Note that with ST506 type hard disks, the disk itself is attached to a
separate disk controller unit, which in turn attaches to a host computer
interface.

At the time of the Atari, hard disks paired with ST506 type controllers were
popularly characterized not by the interface (ST506), but by the recording
method used by the controller: either modified frequency modulation (MFM) or
run-length limited (RLL).

Sold by SWP for 64KiB ATR8000 units (with CP/M) for the Atari (1986):
5MB, 10MB, or 20MB hard disk packages with SWP host adapter (40 pin header
connector to controller), WD1002-HDO MFM controller (ST506 interface: 34 pin
header drive control + 20 pin header data connectors), and "a new CP/M" with
ZCPR3 option.  Can be partitioned for MYDOS &amp; CP/M, plus MS-DOS for CO-POWER. 
The SWP ATR8000 hard disk interface supports up to 32MB of hard disk storage.

Also, some hard disk "bridge" controllers allow a ST506 type hard disk to be
attached to a computer's SASI/SCSI interface.  Such controllers were popular
for use with the Atari SASI/SCSI interfaces that require a controller
supporting 256-byte sectors.  Suitable ST506 controllers for this purpose
include: Adaptec ACB-4000A (SCSI), Adaptec ACB-4070 (SCSI), Western Digital
WD1002-SHD (SASI), Xebec S1410 (SASI), Xebec S1410A (SASI)

------------------------------

Subject: 3.3.3) How can I use a SASI or SCSI interface hard disk?

Shugart Associates System Interface (SASI) ("sassy") was a parallel interface
developed initially at disk drive maker Shugart Associates in the early 1980s,
which was adopted as a formal ANSI standard in June 1986 under the name, Small
Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) ("scuzzy").  SCSI supports many types of
computer peripherals, including hard disk drives.

Many hard disk drives were produced with an embedded disk controller featuring
a SASI or SCSI interface, though only some of these support 256-byte sectors
as required by many Atari SASI/SCSI interfaces.  Suitable SCSI drives meeting
this requirement include: Seagate ST-225N (20MB), Rodime RO650 (10MB) and
RO652 (20MB), Iomega Alpha 10H (10MB) and Beta removable cartridge drives

Also, some hard disk "bridge" controllers allow a ST506 type hard disk to be
attached to a computer's SASI/SCSI interface.  Such controllers were popular
for use with the Atari SASI/SCSI interfaces that require a controller
supporting 256-byte sectors.  Suitable ST506 controllers meeting this
requirement include: Adaptec ACB-4000A (SCSI), Adaptec ACB-4070 (SCSI),
Western Digital WD1002-SHD (SASI), Xebec S1410 (SASI), Xebec S1410A (SASI)

The following are SASI or SCSI interfaces for the Atari that allow the use of
a SASI or SCSI interface hard disk drive.

Subject: 3.3.4) How can I use an IDE interface hard disk or CompactFlash card?

(background derived from Wikipedia)
Parallel ATA (PATA), previously AT Attachment (ATA) and originally Integrated
Drive Electronics (IDE), is an interface standard for the connection of
storage devices such as hard disks, floppy drives, and optical disc drives in
computers.  The standard is maintained by X3/INCITS committee.

The IDE standard was first used in 1986 in the Compaq Deskpro 396 with
integrated Western Digital hard disk drive controller.  IDE was based on the
IBM PC Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) 16-bit bus standard.  

ATAPI is the standard protocol allowing the ATA interface to carry SCSI
commands and responses.  Common ATAPI devices include CD-ROM drives, DVD-ROM
drives, and Zip drives.

CompactFlash (CF) is essentially a mass storage device format with a
miniaturized ATA interface, normally using flash memory.  The format was first
specified and produced by SanDisk in 1994.

The following hardware interfaces were designed to allow PATA devices to be
used with the 8-bit Atari:

==&gt; KMK/JZ IDE (1996) and KMK/JZ/IDEa (2004)
- Allows you to attach an ATA (IDE) hard drive, a CF (Compact Flash) card or
  an ATAPI device (e.g. a CD-ROM drive) to your Atari XE computer.  Drive must
  be ATA-1 or later; at least ATA-2 is recommended.  Dual drives supported.

Subject: 3.3.5) How can I use a Secure Digital (SD) card with my Atari?

(SD background derived from Wikipedia)
Secure Digital (SD) is a flash memory (non-volatile) memory card format used
since 1999 in portable devices, including digital cameras, handheld computers,
PDAs and GPS units.  SD was based on the MultiMediaCard (MMC), which was
introduced in 1997 by SanDisk and Siemens.

The SD format includes four card families available in three different form
factors.  The four families are the original Standard-Capacity (SDSC), the
High-Capacity (SDHC), the eXtended-Capacity (SDXC), and the SDIO, which
combines input/output functions with data storage.  The three form factors are
the original size, the "mini" size, and the "micro" size.  There are many
combinations of form factors and device families.

==&gt; SIO2SD, by Jakub Kruszona-Zawadzki, Pajero/MadTeam, Jakub Husak
Load games/applications into 8-bit Atari computers via SIO interface from 
SD/MMC cards.  Device features:
 - Supported cards: 
   MMC/SDSC/SDHC (and very likely with SDXC, but only FAT32 formated) 
 - Supported partitioning schemas: 
   no partition, MBR (Master Boot Record), GPT (GUID Partition Table - EFI) 
 - Supported formats: FAT12,FAT16 and FAT32 
 - Handles ATR (rw), XFD (ro) and COM/XEX (ro) file types 
 - 16x2 LCD display allows to "walk" catalog tree and choose files to load 
   (40x2 LCD displays are also supported) 
 - TURBO: 7th bit of command switches turbo.  This is new turbo mode very 
   similar to XF551 turbo mode. 
 - All densities with 128B and 256B sectors, including 16MiB disks 
 - Number of simulated drives: 15 + 100 
 - Configuration program: 
    - has to be present on SD card, but any program can be used 
 - New ATR files and new folders can be created using SIO commands 
 - "Empty disk" mode (ATR file created automatically during format command) 
 - Deleting files from card using SIO commands 
 - Renaming files and folders using SIO commands 
 - Reading and writting all files using SIO commands (inside Atari folder and
   subfolders) 
 - 100 extra "virtual drives" V0..V99, which can be mapped to any drive from
   D1 to D15 
 - Fast mapping - Drives V0 to V3 have additional, special meaning.  When one
   of keys from K1 to K4 is pressed during start then device overrides mapping
   of D1 and maps one of those drives to D1 (K1 = V0, K2 = V1 etc.). 
 - Builtin very simple TURBO loader (for 7th bit mode - turbo mode similar to
   one used in XF551)

Subject: 3.3.6) How can I use a USB flash drive with my Atari?

USB flash drives are NAND-type flash memory data storage devices integrated
with a USB (universal serial bus) interface.  They are typically small,
lightweight, removable and rewritable.

==&gt; SIO2USB, by ABBUC Regional Group Frankfurt / Main (2007)
The SIO2USB Interface is a peripheral device that can be attached to an Atari
8-bit computer using the SIO-Bus.  It emulates one or more Atari Floppy-
Drive(s) and does not require any special drivers or Operating-Systems, it is
fully compatible with all Atari DOS Systems and extensions.  Because the
device is connected to the SIO-Bus, it is not necessary to open or modify the
Atari.  The device is powered by the SIO-Bus and does not need an external
Power Adapter.  The data are stored on standard USB Mass Storage Devices (USB
FLASH Drives) as Atari-Imagefiles (ATR or XFD) on a standard FAT filesystem.
Features:
 o Can boot an Atari 8-bit Computer without physical Floppy Drive
 o Emulation of up to 3 (virtual) Disk drives simultaneously
 o Simple device, attached to SIO-Port, no modification of computer necessary
 o Mixed operation of real Floppy and SIO2USB possible
 o Fully compatible with all Atari DOS and OS and all Atari compatible
   extensions
 o Storage of Atari-Imagefiles on standard USB FLASH Drives
 o Configuration of the device by built-in keys and LC-Display or
   configuration program on the Atari
 o Built-in Real Time Clock (RTC)
 o Power supply for the device and USB FLASH Drive from SIO-Bus
 o Updated SIO2USB Firmware can be applied from within the Atari (no
   additional device or computer required)
 o Updates available via Internet (USB FLASH Drive) or direct from the Atari
   (real Disk Drive)

==&gt; ATARIBUS project by Dave Warker, 1982/1983
A hardware interface design and CP/M software package that links an Atari
computer to CP/M compatible computers.  Features (disk emulation):
 - Provides up to four pseudo-drives to the ATARI.  To Atari DOS they appear
   as devices D1: through D4:.  What they actually are is 90KiB byte CP/M disk
   files.  The records of these disk files are treated as sectors of the Atari
   disk.
 - The standard extensions for Pseudo-Disk (PD) files are ATR, AT1, AT2, AT3
   or AT4.  'ATR' is used in most cases.  (Pre-dates the SIO2PC ATR standard!)

Turn your Linux machine into the Atari computer's floppy drive.
- Based on Floppy EMULater by Pavel Machek
- Need to use an SIO2PC cable
- No kernel modules.
  Unlike the AtariSIO project, this is just a simple user-space program that

  highest-numbered sector written.
- Mount your native file system as an Atari disk
  It's read-only for now, and it doesn't support subdirectories, but each
  file is mapped to a different starting sector, and as that sector is read,
  it automatically maps in the rest of the file.

Subject: 4.6) How can I use a Centronics or IBM parallel interface printer?

What is now known as IEEE 1284 originated as the "Parallel Interface
Specification for Centronics Printers," a unidirectional 8 bit host-to-printer
connection.  This interface was introduced by Centronics Data Computer
Corporation for a series of small serial-impact printers that began with
1970's Centronics Model 101.  Centronics defined the interface timing and
signals as well as the interface connector (at the printer), but not the host
connector (at the computer).  The Centronics parallel interface eventually
became the primary interface used between most small computers and associated
printers.

Even as Centronics themselves began utilizing alternative interface connectors
on some of their own printers, the market success of 1980's Epson MX-80 helped
the industry settle on Centronics' original choice of the 36-contact Amphenol
57-40360 (Micro-Ribbon brand) miniature-ribbon receptacle (female) as the
standard interface connector found on parallel interface printers.  The
corresponding cable connector is the 36-contact Amphenol 57-30360 (Micro-
Ribbon brand) miniature-ribbon plug (male).  36 contact miniature-ribbon
connectors became known popularly as "Centronics" connectors; these are now
known as the IEEE 1284-B Receptacle and Plug connectors.

IBM introduced the IBM PC in August 1981, with a Centronics-like Parallel
Interface (with DB-25S connector), along with a series of Centronics-like
parallel interface printers (with "Centronics" connector) starting with the
IBM PC Graphics Printer (model 5152, a slightly-modified Epson MX-80).  The
Parallel Interface as implemented by IBM was compatible with a functional
subset of the existing Centronics standard, but more complete implementations
of the IBM and Centronics interfaces were not signal-compatible, and a new
category of the "IBM" compatible printer was established.  Market success of
the IBM PC meant wide adoption of the IBM parallel interface standard.  This
included the DB-25S host connector, which is now also known as the IEEE 1284-A
Receptacle.

Industry implementations of the Centronics/IBM parallel interface continued to
vary until the 1994 publication and subsequent wide adoption of IEEE 1284,
"IEEE Standard Signaling Method for a Bidirectional Parallel Peripheral
Interface for Personal Computers."   The current version is IEEE 1284-2000.

The 8-bit Atari computer does not include a Centronics parallel output
interface, but one may be added to the system.  Atari provided the 850
Interface, and later the XEP80 Interface, for this purpose.  Many 3rd-party
interfaces and other devices provide compatible interfaces.

The following should be a complete list of devices for the Atari providing the
system with a Centronics parallel printer host interface.  Interfaces connect
to the Atari via SIO unless otherwise specified, and are compatible with the
Atari 850 Printer port unless otherwise specified.  The interface connector
type is given if known.

Subject: 5.1) What are the Atari 830, 835, 1030, XM301, and SX212 Modems?

Thanks to Laurent Delsarte for some of the research and writing for this
section.

A modem (MOdulator-DEModulator) is a device that modulates an analog carrier
signal to encode digital information for transmittal, and also demodulates
such a carrier signal to decode received transmitted information.  The common
example from the main time period of the 8-bit Atari computers is the voice
band modem, otherwise known as a "dial-up modem" that turns the digital data
of a personal computer into modulated electrical signals in the voice
frequency range of a telephone channel.  These signals can be transmitted over
telephone lines and demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to
recover the digital data.  Thus, in this pre-Internet form of computer
networking, any two computers may communicate with each other over a standard
telephone line.

The first commercially successful modem was the Bell 103 from AT&amp;T.  While the
AT&amp;T Bell System maintained monopolistic control over the direct connection to
its phone lines in the USA, third-party manufacturers could only offer
"acoustic" modem configurations.  Acoustic modems featured a cradle designed
to fit snugly around the microphone and earpiece of a standard (of the time)
Bell telephone handset.  A standard Bell telephone was utilized for it's
microphone, speaker, and dialing capabilities.  Such modems were designed to
be interoperable with the Bell 103, which maintained its role as the effective
industry standard.

Later "direct-connect" modems, led by the Hayes Smartmodem, instead connected
directly to the phone line.  These modems contained their own microphones,
speakers, and dialing capabilities controlled via software.  The "Hayes
command set" successfully established the industry standard for controlling
modem features via computer software.

Most voice band modems have a pass-through line allowing a standard telephone
to be physically connected to the line while the modem is also connected.
However, voice and data cannot be transmitted at the same time over the same
phone line (as is possible with newer telecommunication technologies such as
ISDN and DSL).  When online using a dial-up modem, before telephone services
like voice mail were common, incoming callers would experience a "busy signal"
as if someone was already talking on the line.  This limitation was finally
addressed in 2001 with the V.92 modem standard.  V.92 includes a "Modem On
Hold" capability, especially useful in combination with the phone company's
"call waiting" and "caller ID on call waiting" features.

A wide variety of modulation and communication techniques can be successfully
implemented over a standard telephone line.  In order for two modems to
communicate, they have to initially successfully negotiate the technical
nature of the communications to be used between them.  Connection
characteristics include modulation technique ("frequency shift keying", "phase
shift keying", etc.), operation mode (one-way "half duplex" or bi-directional
"full duplex"), synchronization ("asynchronous" data without clock signal or
"synchronous" data accompanied by separate clock signal), and bitrate
(measured in bits per second).  Early modem users had to become familiar with
arcane settings such as these in order to establish successful modem to modem
communications.  In time, modem modulation standards were established and
adopted by the industry, allowing for the details to largely become
transparent to the user.  Newer modems would simply negotiate the fastest and
most reliable connection possible between them, given the best capabilities of
both modems.  Major modem modulation standards:

  Standard   (Year appeared)  Top Bitrate  Baud(symbols per second)
    Bell 103 modem  (1962)     300 bit/s    300 (V.21 precursor)
    Bell 212A modem (1977)    1200 bit/s    600 (V.22 precursor)
    V.22bis         (1982)    2400 bit/s    600
    V.32            (1986)    9600 bit/s   2400
    V.32bis         (1991)   14400 bit/s   2400
    AT&amp;T V.32ter    (1993)   19200 bit/s   3200 ("terbo"; V.34 precursor)
    Rockwell V.FC   (1993)   28800 bit/s   3200 ("Fast Class"; V.34 precursor)
    V.34            (1994)   28800 bit/s   3200
    V.34            (1996)   33600 bit/s   3429 ("V.34 Plus" or "V.34bis")
    US Robotics X2  (1997)   56000 bit/s   8000 (V.90 precursor)
    Rockwell K56flex(1997)   56000 bit/s   8000 (V.90 precursor)
    V.90            (1998)   56000 bit/s   8000
    V.92            (2001)   56000 bit/s   8000

At the time, it was very common for modem speed bit rates to be incorrectly
referred to as "baud" rates.  Other than the early 300 bit/s / 300 baud
modulation standard this was never correct usage of the term.  Baud always
meant "symbols per second" rather than "bits per second."

Two additional important modem standards emerged in 1990: V.42 error control
and V.42bis data compression.  V.42 and V.42bis were implemented in some later
V.22bis and V.32 modems, and probably in all modems supporting V.32bis and up.
V.92 modems, which appeared in 2001, support V.44 data compression, an 
improvement over V.42bis compression.

In the early 1980s popular early commercial online services reached via dial-
up modem included CompuServe Information Service, Dow Jones Information
Service, and The Source.  In addition to CompuServe, later online services
popular with Atari users included Delphi and GEnie.  Modem users would also
dial in to mainframe computer systems at universities, or they would log in to
privately-operated Bulletin Board Systems running on other personal computers.
As long-distance telephone services were billed by the minute, telephone bill
expenses were an important consideration.

Atari produced several modems for use with the 8-bit Atari computers.  Each
Atari brand modem supports U.S. modulation communication standards only; Atari
did not market their modems in Europe.

Beyond the above modem models, most any industry standard (of the time)
external RS-232-C serial modem can work well with the Atari.  These were
commonly sold for PCs for many years.  The Hayes Smartmodem more or less
defined the market for these, initially.  Normally modems featured a DB-25S
connector for interfacing to the computer.

The original, most common, and most trouble-free way to use such a modem with
the Atari is to attach it to the #1 RS-232-C serial port (DE-9S) of the Atari
850 Interface Module or equivalent, using an Atari CX87 Modem Cable or
equivalent (DE-9P to DB-25P).  Note that the standard "modem cable" used with
PCs of the era was DE-9S to DB-25P.  Such a cable combined with a simple DE-9
P-P gender converter creates the equivalent of the Atari CX87 Modem Cable.

A less common way to connect a standard external modem with DB-25S connector
to the Atari is to connect it to the Atari SIO port via an R-Verter Serial Bus
Modem Adapter (Atari SIO to DB-25P) by Advanced Interface Devices (A.I.D.),
later sold as the SupraVerter by Supra, or equivalent.

Note that the top modem bitrate that can be utilized by the Atari, under ideal
circumstances, is 19200 bit/s.  Modems capable of faster bitrates work fine,
they just can't be operated at their full speeds.

Later external modems designed for newer PCs connected to a USB port on the PC
instead of the standard DB-9P serial port found on earlier PCs.

------------------------------

Subject: 5.3) What should I know about using fast modems with the Atari?

While Atari never marketed a modem faster than the 1200 bit/s SX212, the Atari
is capable of supporting modem bitrates of up to 19200 bit/s, depending upon
circumstances described here.

Several factors come into play in using modems faster than 2400 bit/s with the
Atari.

Firstly, the top bitrate supported by a given software application on the
Atari can be the determinative limiting factor.  Many programs on the Atari
may not support, or may not be able to keep up with, bitrates greater than
1200 bit/s or 2400 bit/s.

Assuming the use of an Atari program that supports higher speeds, it will be
useful to have an understanding of data flow control.  Here is a definition of
flow control from: <a href=http://preview.tinyurl.com/p8muzmp>http://preview.tinyurl.com/p8muzmp</a>

 Often, one modem in a connection is capable of sending data much faster than
 the other can receive.  Flow control allows the receiving modem to tell the
 other to pause while it catches up.  Flow control exists as either software
 (XON/XOFF) flow control, or hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control.  With software
 flow control, when a modem needs to tell the other to pause, it sends a
 certain character, usually Control-S.  When it is ready to resume, it sends a
 different character, such as Control-Q.  Software flow control's only
 advantage is that it can use a serial cable with only three wires.  Since
 software flow control regulates transmissions by sending certain characters,
 line noise could generate the character commanding a pause, thus hanging the
 transfer until the proper character (such as Control-Q) is sent.  Also,
 binary files must never be sent using software flow control, as binary files
 can contain the control characters.  Hardware, or RTS/CTS, flow control uses
 wires in the modem cable or, in the case of internal modems, hardware in the
 modem.  This is faster and much more reliable than software flow control.

Some/later 2400 bit/s modems, and probably all modems with 9600 bit/s speed
capabilities and up, normally use V.42 standard error correction and V.42bis
standard data compression.  Subjectively, V.42/V.42bis are nice at 2400 bit/s,
important at 9600 bit/s, and essential at any speeds beyond 9600 bit/s.

V.42bis requires hardware flow control (and V.42 error correction).  But with
Atari equipment (except the MIO and Black Box) hardware flow control is not
supported so V.42bis cannot be used and should be disabled.  Standard Hayes
modem command to disable V.42bis data compression: AT&amp;C0

While V.42 error correction can technically work with either software or
hardware flow control, for reasons described above it is typically only used
when hardware flow control is available.  Since Atari equipment (except the
MIO and Black Box) does not support hardware flow control, V.42 should
generally be disabled.  Standard Hayes modem command to disable V.42 error
correction: AT&amp;K0 
Note that disabling V.42 also has the effect of disabling V.42bis.

Finally, hardware ports on the Atari have their inherent top bitrate limits.
The serial ports of the Atari 850, for example, support a top bitrate of 9600
bit/s.  Other modem interfaces for the Atari may support bitrates of up to
19200 bit/s.

Clay Halliwell offers a tip on achieving 9600 bit/s through the 850 Interface:
 On 11 Feb 1996, Marc G. Frank said:

 &gt; I'm having problems getting a modem attached to my Atari 850 to
 &gt; communicate at 9600 baud.  When I set my communications program to 2400
 &gt; baud, everything works fine.  However, when I set it to 9600 baud, the
 &gt; modem echoes my characters but doesn't act on them.

 The problem with the 850 is that some of them (like mine) don't produce a
 PERFECT 9600 baud signal.  As a result modems can't train on it, and while
 they will echo characters back, for some nitpicky reason they won't pick up
 on the "AT" attention code.

 The solution is to do all your dialing at 2400 baud, but set the S37
 register to force the modem to try to connect at 9600.  Then switch your
 Atari to 9600 after connecting.

Subject: 5.4) What networking hardware is there for the Atari?

==&gt; CSS Deluxe Quintopus
Share SIO devices between 2 computers.  The Deluxe Quintopus consists of a box
with two switched SIO ports and 4 unswitched SIO ports.

<a href=http://www.nleaudio.com/css/products/quintopus.htm>http://www.nleaudio.com/css/products/quintopus.htm</a>

==&gt; Supra MicroNet
Supports the connection of one SIO chain of peripherals to up to 8 computers.
When one computer accesses a peripheral device, the entire bus is occupied so
that the other computers on the "network" must wait.  The bus is freed five
seconds after a computer finishes interacting with the peripheral.

A printer/data buffer can make the MicroNet more practical.

Supra also provided a modified Atari DOS 2.5 that would re-try disk accesses
repeatedly in response to SIO timeouts.

==&gt; CSS Multiplexer ("MUX")
Description from the CSS online catalog:

The Multiplexer is a collection of cartridge interface boards that allow up to
8 Ataris to read and write to the same drives (typically a hard disk), access
the same printer(s), and talk to each other.  It is the first practical
networking system for the Atari 8-bit computer.

One "master" computer (any 8-bit) is equipped with the master Multiplexer
interface.  Then up to 8 "slave" computers hook up to this master, each having
their own slave interface.  The slave interface consists of a cartridge that
plugs into the cartridge port.  It has its own socket on the top so you can
use whatever cartridges you desire with the system.

The "common" peripherals (things that are to be shared) are connected to the
master.  On each slave, all disk and printer I/O is routed through the master
so no extra disk drives are needed.  The master computer can be configured in
any manner you wish.  You may have certain peripherals local to the slave or
routed to a different number on the master.  Note that serial ports (R: RS-232
interfaces) are not multiplexed.  All slaves are independent and do not need
to have the same program running on them.

==&gt; GameLink and GameLink-II

Two hardware designs by Chuck Steinman of DataQue support the linking of two
or more Atari computers.  Each supports multiple user head-to-head gaming
where each player uses a separate computer (each with separate TV/monitor).

(GameLink and GameLink-II descriptions by Andreas Koch)

a) GameLink: This hardware was developed in 1989/90.  It links two
   computers together via the joystick ports.  It is limited to a maximum
   of 2 computers and thus 2 or 6 players, meaning one free port per
   XL/XE computer and 3 free ports per 400/800 computer.  However, the
   few existing games for this hardware merely support 2 players.

b) GameLink-II: This hardware was developed in 1991/92.  It links 2 to 8
   computers together via the SIO ports.  One computer will then act as
   the master and has to boot up the software (from tape, disk, hard disk,
   etc.) first.  Then all other "slave" computers connect to it and boot
   off of this master computer (one after another of course).  In Europe
   we call this device "Multilink", mostly because of the games written
   by Bewesoft (Jiri Bernasek) called Multi-Dash, Multi-Race, Multi-Worms.
   A two computer network can easily be done with one SIO cable, just
   open the end of the SIO cable and exchange cables number 3 and 5.  You
   now have an easy two computer (2-4 players) network cable.

networking?"

==&gt; AT-Link (Alphasys)
Arianne Slaager writes:
I was actually surprised to read about the GameLink, as I made a similar
cable myself, called the AT-Link.  This cable could also be used to
communicate with Commodore 64 computers, and I made driver software for both
systems at the time.  There were 2 drivers.  One as relocatable machine code,
and another as device driver.  Also in the package was a 2 player Battleships
type game where Side A had the Atari version, and Side B the Commodore 64
version.

...wasn't more than two old joystick cables in a crosslink configuration,
(Pin 1 and 2 linked to pin 3 and 4 of the other cable respectively) 

==&gt; EightLink (Alphasys)
Arianne Slaager writes:
I also made a special high-speed Atari to Atari cable, called the EightLink.
This one was cartridge based system, with a PIA inside, which boasted a 8 bit
bidirectional, parallel databus, and a 4 bit crosslinked control bus.
Transfer speeds were such that two Ataris on opposite ends of a large hall
could transfer disk data faster than it could be read or written.  The actual
cable connecting the two was a flatcable with 33 leads, alternating ground and
a dataline across the width to minimise crossover disruption of data.  Also
for this link system, I made drivers both in relocatable code, as well as a
device driver.

Subject: 5.5) How can I connect my Atari to a high-speed/Ethernet network?

Two options are presented here:
  - Option #1 is a generic LAN/RS-232 interface from Lantronix
  - Option #2 is a native ethernet interface for the Atari

Option #1
=-=-=-=-=
Marius Diepenhorst pioneered the use of Lantronix devices.  He writes (2004):

  "Try to get a Lantronix UDS-10 device.  It acts like a modem but it is a LAN
  -&gt; RS-232 converter.  So with that device you can have incoming and outgoing
  'calls' like modem ones via the Internet.

  I ran my Atari 8-bit BBS with such a thing.  The Lantronix UDS-10 or MSS100
  will do too.  But in that case you have to make a custom RS-232 cable (easy
  job)."

<a href=http://www.lantronix.com/device-networking/external-device-servers/uds-10.html>http://www.lantronix.com/device-networking/external-device-servers/uds-10.html</a>

Other, similar serial-to-Ethernet interfaces from Lantronix have been
successfully utilized, including the discontinued MSS100
(<a href=http://www.lantronix.com/support/discontinued/mss100.html>http://www.lantronix.com/support/discontinued/mss100.html</a>) and MSS1-T.

Option #2
=-=-=-=-=
The Atari 8-Bit Ethernet Project is developing a hardware/software solution
that will be able to connect to the internet via an Atari 8-bit Ethernet 
Cartridge.

The hardware and software was originally developed by Chris Martin and tested
by Mark Dusko.  The software is based on the work already done in the
Commodore 64 community, this adapter will allow you to take advantage of
telnet, e-mail, web browsing and a web server via the Contiki Operating System
and a Ciris Logic CS8900A ethernet controller chip. 

The main component is called the IP Dragon II; the official cartridge name is
the Dragon Cart.

Subject: 6.1.1) What is the Atari 850 Interface Module?

While the Atari's SIO and controller ports did not conform to established
industry standards, Atari produced the 850 Interface Module to provide access
to devices complying with two important interface standards of the time,
RS-232-C serial and Centronics parallel.

RS-232-C Serial Interface
-------------------------
The Electronic Industries Association (EIA) introduced the RS-232 standard,
entitled "Interface Between Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and Data Circuit-
Terminating Equipment (DCE) Employing Serial Binary Data Interchange," in 1960
in an effort to standardize the interface between DTE (usually a terminal or a
computer emulating a terminal) and DCE (usually a modem).  Although emphasis
then was placed on interfacing between a modem unit and DTE, other
applications for the standard gained popularity.  Early versions of the EIA
232 standard included RS-232 (1960), RS-232-A (1963), and RS-232-B (1965).
From 1969-1987, including most of the time of the 8-bit Atari, the standard
was formally known as EIA RS-232-C.  Revisions since then have included EIA-
232-D (1987), EIA/TIA-232-E (1991), and the current version from the
Telecommunications Industry Association, EIA/TIA-232-F (1997), known as of
2011 as TIA-232-F.  Especially in the 1980s, 232 was widely adopted for low-
cost serial connections between the DTE and peripherals such as an external
modem, mouse, plotter, printer, scanner, digitizer, track ball, and myriad
others.  In more recent years TIA-232-F has essentially been supplanted by
USB.  In keeping with the context of the time period, this FAQ will normally
refer to the 232 standard as RS-232-C.  

The Atari 850 interface connects to the SIO port on the Atari computer and
provides the system with:

- Four serial interface ports (RS-232-C)
- One 8-bit parallel output interface port (Centronics)

Serial interface port key features:
- The 850 functions as RS-232-C Data Terminal Equipment (DTE).

The Atari Operating System does not include a resident device handler for the
serial ports of the 850, but the 850 contains an R: handler, supporting
devices R1: through R4:, in its ROM.  With no powered disk drive #1 present,
the R: handler loads from the ROM of a powered 850 into computer RAM on system
startup.  An extended beep is emitted through the computer's audio signal as
the handler is loaded.  The R: handler can also be loaded from the 850 ROM as
part of a Disk Boot (Atari DOS 2.0S, DOS 3, DOS 2.5, and DOS XE include
provisions for this) or afterward.  Many alternatives to the 850 ROM R:
handler exist as well.  Please see a separate section of this FAQ list
regarding R: and T: device handlers for the 850 for more details.

The Atari Operating System's resident P: Printer device handler supports the
parallel output interface port of the 850.

Subject: 6.1.2) What is the Atari XEP80 Interface Module?

The Atari XEP80 interface connects to joystick port 1 or 2 on the Atari
computer and provides the system with:

- An 80-column Video Display Controller (phono output jack)
- A Parallel Printer Port (Centronics output interface)

(Note that the XEP80 does not include provision for audio.  Audio may be
supplied from the Atari computer monitor port.)

VIDEO DISPLAY CONTROLLER
The XEP80 video hardware generates an 80 column by 25 line text display
through a video connector/cable plugged into a separately purchased monitor.
The monitor can be any Composite Video input type, although for the best
display a monochrome is strongly advised.

Internally, the XEP80 is a 256 character wide by 25 line high storage device
with an 80 column wide display window.  Characters may be placed anywhere
within the device independent of the window location.  The window may be
scrolled across the 256 column wide field.

Optionally, the XEP80 may be placed into Pixel Graphics mode.  This mode
supports a bit mapped (pixel) screen of 320 dots (40 bytes) horizontal by 200
dots (lines) vertical.  The output window displayed is approximately half the
size of the text window.

PARALLEL PORT
The XEP80 supports a functional subset of the Centronics or PC parallel
printer interface (standards introduced elsewhere in this FAQ list), using the
IBM PC standard (1981) connector.  Note that the Atari Operating System
resident P: device handler does not support a printer attached via joystick
port, so a substitute P: handler must be installed in RAM in order for Atari
software to recognize the XEP80 parallel port for printing.

SOFTWARE
The XEP80 Handler and Relocator is provided on diskette in the form of a DOS
binary file named AUTORUN.SYS.  This file is automatically loaded into memory
and initialized by the DOS at boot (power on) time.
Contents of the XEP80 Boot Disk: (DX5087)
  DOS.SYS       DOS 2.5 File Management Subsystem (FMS)
  DUP.SYS       DOS 2.5 Disk Utility Package (DUP)
  AUTORUN.SYS   XEP80 Handler and Relocator.
                Substitute versions for three OS-resident device handlers:
                 - S: Display Handler
                 - E: Screen Editor
                   Designed to be compatible with the standard E: device but
                   for the XEP80 80-column screen display.
                 - P: Printer.
                   Default configuration supports 8 different printer devices:
                      P1: XEP80 parallel port
                      P2: 850 Interface Module parallel port (e.g., Atari 825)
                      P3: 1025 Printer
                      P4: 1020 Color Plotter

                      P7: XMM801 Printer
                      P8: XDM121 Printer
                   The handler interprets P: (no device number) to mean P1:.

Hold down [Shift] while loading the XEP80 Handler and Relocator (AUTORUN.SYS)
to load the P: handler but not the S: and E: handlers (use the XEP80 for its
parallel printer port only).

The key engineer/designer of the XEP80 was Jose Valdes at Atari.
Lane Winner was software developer for the XEP80 at Atari.
The XEP80 was made in Taiwan.

The XEP80 draws 400mA of current from an external power supply.  Use a power
supply that delivers 500mA 9V DC (center positive).  Shipped with Atari
C016353 or C018084.

Subject: 6.1.3) What were the 1060 CP/M Module and 1090 XL Expansion System?

The Atari CP/M Module was shown at the June 1983 Consumer Electronics Show in
Chicago.  Later dubbed the 1060, housed in a case greatly resembling the 1050
disk drive, features were to include: Z-80A microprocessor, 4.0MHz processing
speed, 64KiB RAM, CP/M 2.2 Operating System, 40/80-column video output
(switchable), Serial input/output port (Atari SIO), Monitor output.  CP/M
software in Atari diskette format was to be supplied by Add-On Software, Inc.,
who expected to initially offer: Wordstar (MicroPro International), dBASE II
(Allied Computer Services), Peachpak (Peachtree Software), Pascal/MT+ (Digital
Research), CBASIC (Digital Research), SuperWriter (Sorcim), SuperCalc
(Sorcim), Multiplan (Microsoft), MBASIC (Microsoft), and perhaps: MicroSort,
Supersoft FORTH, Personal Pearl Database Manager.  Atari confirmed the
cancellation of the unshipped 1060 in January 1984.  No more than a handful
of prototype units may exist.
<a href=http://www.atarimuseum.com/computers/8BITS/XL/xlperipherals/1060/1060.html>http://www.atarimuseum.com/computers/8BITS/XL/xlperipherals/1060/1060.html</a>

The Atari Expansion Box was first shown at the June 1983 Consumer Electronics
Show in Chicago.  Later dubbed the 1090 XL Expansion System, and intended to
replace the 850 interface, the 1090 would plug into the PBI on
600XL/800XL/1400XL/1450XLD computers to provide: two RS-232-C serial
input/output ports, one Centronics-type parallel output port, and five
internal 8-bit PBI card slots.  Three prototype XL Expansion Cards for the
1090 have been identified: the 1066 CP/M card (1090 card version of the
prototype 1060 CP/M Module), an 80-column video card (perhaps necessary for
the 1066 CP/M card to be usable), and a 64KiB RAM card that by June 1984 was
promoted to ship with the 1090. Atari continued to promote the 1090 through
June 1984.  A handful of prototypes exist, but the 1090 was never shipped.
Few if any working prototype XL Expansion Cards for the 1090 exist.

Subject: 6.1.4) What MIDI interfaces are there for the Atari?

From Wikipedia (10.28.2012):
MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is an electronic musical
instrument industry specification that enables a wide variety of digital
musical instruments, computers and other related devices to connect and
communicate with one another.  It is a set of standard commands that allows
electronic musical instruments, performance controllers, computers and related
devices to communicate, as well as a hardware standard that guarantees
compatibility between them.

Subject: 6.1.5) How can I use an ISA device with my my Atari?

(Background derived from Wikipedia)
Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) is a computer bus standard for IBM PC
compatible computers introduced with the IBM Personal Computer (1981) to
support its Intel 8088 microprocessor's 8-bit external data bus, and extended
to 16 bits in 1984 for the IBM Personal Computer/AT with Intel 80286.  The ISA
bus was further extended for use with 32-bit processors as Extended Industry
Standard Architecture (EISA) in 1988.

RoBue (Roland Buehler) of the Stuttgart ABBUC Regional Group has produced
project plans for an ISA-Bus Interface for Atari 800XL/130XE Computer.
https://atariwiki.strotmann.de/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=ARGS%20ISA%20PC%20Interface

Carsten Strotmann has released source code showing how to access a Hercules
video card with the ISA-Bus Interface: <a href=http://preview.tinyurl.com/po6yyys>http://preview.tinyurl.com/po6yyys</a>

Subject: 6.1.6) How can I use a USB device with my Atari?

"Universal Serial Bus Specification Revision 1.0" was published January 15,
1996, with industry participation from Compaq, Digital Equipment Corporation,
IBM PC Company, Intel, Microsoft, NEC, and Northern Telecom.  The
specification describes the bus attributes, the protocol definition, types of
transactions, bus management, and the programming interface required to design
and build systems and peripherals that are compliant with this standard.  The
USB 1.0 full speed signaling bit rate is 12 Mbit/s; a limited capability low
speed signaling mode is also defined at 1.5 Mbit/s.  USB 2.0 (2000) added a
480 Mbit/s mode; USB 3.0 (2008) added a 5 Gbit/s mode.

Beginning in 1997 USB ports gradually replaced RS-232 serial and Centronics-
type parallel ports on modern personal computers, becoming the primary means
for connecting external devices such as a keyboard, mouse, joystick, speaker,
microphone, modem, webcam, scanner, printer, or mass storage device.

The following project aims to provide USB compatibility to the Atari:

Subject: 6.2) What are the power requirements for my Atari components?

  Some of the pictures were scraped from various Internet web sites by MC;
  Some of the pics are originals by: MC (generally, common 120V supplies),
  Laurent Delsarte (many of the 220V supplies, the 16804, the 9W CX261,
  the C017945/566T, the C060529), wood_jl ("Black Brick"), 
  Dan of (<a href=http://www.southtown-homebrew.com/>http://www.southtown-homebrew.com/</a>) (830 supply), 
  dean_rambler (C062195), E. Turner (C060479)

The household "mains" electricity supply is an alternating current (AC) that
can be described with two parameters: the voltage (in volts) and the frequency
(in Hz).

In North America, the standard household wall outlet offers 120V/60Hz power.
In some of the rest of the world, the mains is now standardizing to 230V/50Hz.
However, other combinations of voltages of 100V-127V or 220V-240V paired with
frequencies of either 50Hz or 60Hz remain standard.  Here is the Wikipedia
article listing current household power outlet standards in use throughout the
world: <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mains_electricity_by_country>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mains_electricity_by_country</a>

In the time of 8-bit Atari computers and peripherals, North America still used
120V/60Hz, most of continental Europe used 220V/50Hz, and the UK used
240V/50Hz.

In any case, the household alternating current must be converted to a
direct current (DC) for use by electrical devices such as Atari computers
and peripherals:

 o In some cases, the entire conversion is done via an external "power supply"
   that sits between the wall outlet and the electrical device.  Such power
   supplies both transform the household power to a lower voltage, and they
   also rectify the current from AC to DC.

 o In some cases, the external "power supply" is simply a transformer that
   lowers the household voltage.  The lowered AC voltage is rectified to DC
   inside the device.

 o In some cases, both the transformer and the rectifier are located inside
   the computer or peripheral itself.  The device plugs directly into the wall
   outlet, with no external "power supply" needed.

The INPUT of an external power supply will indicate:
  1) Input voltage in units of volts (120V for N.Am., 220V Euro, 240V UK)
  2) Input frequency in units of hertz (60Hz for N.Am., 50Hz Euro)
  3) Peak power rating.  The power rating is the highest amount of power the
     unit can supply, according to the manufacturer, but this is only for a
     very brief time.  This peak power rating may be indicated in units of
     volt-amperes (VA) or in units of watts (W).

The OUTPUT of an external power supply will indicate:
  1) Output voltage, in units of volts (V)
  2) Whether the output voltage is AC or DC
  3) Either:
    - Sustained output current, in units of amperes (A) or milliamperes (mA)
    - Sustained output power, in units of volt-amperes (VA) or watts (W)

Higher-than-specified sustained power and current capacities are entirely
usable, and often preferable because such supplies run cooler and last longer.

The power units W (watts) and VA (volt-amperes) are not identical:
  Direct Current (DC):
  Power (in watts) = current (in amperes) * voltage (in volts)

  Alternating Current (AC):
  Apparent Power (in volt-amperes) = current (in amperes) * voltage (in volts)
  Effective/True Power (in watts)  = current (in amperes) * voltage (in volts)
                                      * cosine(phase, or angle of lag)
  cosine(phase) is known as the "power factor"

Subject: 6.9) What sound upgrades (stereo or 8-bit PCM) are there?

This section lists programmable system modifications or devices that upgrade
the audio capabilities of the Atari.  Devices or modifications that manipulate
the standard Sound Output beyond the software control of the Atari are not
listed here.

Bits 'N' Pieces: POPS, project by Lee S. Brilliant, ANALOG #66 Nov. 1988,
pages 54-60
- External device connects to the Atari SIO port, using pin 1 (Clock Input)
  and pin 2 (Clock Output) to tap into the separate Atari audio voices
  independently, before the system mixes them into the normal single-channel
  Sound Output signal.
- POPS provides either stereo (Left and Right) or three (Left, Center, and
  Right) audio output channels.
   - Two channel operation: POKEY voice 4 is output to the POPS Left Speaker
     (via SIO pin 2); POKEY voices 1-3 are output to the POPS Right Speaker
     (via the normal system Sound Output)
   - Three channel operation: POKEY voice 2 is output to the Left Speaker (via
     SIO pin 2); POKEY voice 4 is output to the POPS Center speaker (via SIO
     pin 1); POKE voices 1 and 3 are output to the POPS Right Speaker (via the
     normal system Sound Output)
- Software: POKEY Player by Craig Chamberlain, modified by Lee Brilliant M.D.

Subject: 6.11) What types of memory upgrades are there for the Atari?

Thanks to Andreas Koch for his earlier extensive work on RAMdisk versions.

This section attempts to list all commercial or hobbyist project upgrades
to the amount of (volatile) random access memory (RAM) installed in the 8-bit
Atari.
 
Devices that use non-volatile mass storage media would be listed elsewhere in
this FAQ list.

The 8-bit 6502 and ANTIC processors can directly address 64KiB distinct memory
locations, addressed 0-65535 or $0-$FFFF.  Any upgrade providing more total
system RAM than 64KiB must use a bank-selection scheme to allow a range of
logical memory addresses to refer to more than one range of physical memory
locations.

400/800 Memory Upgrades
-----------------------
As designed by Atari, RAM management in the 400/800 is accomplished in
hardware via the presence of up to three RAM Module boards in the 800, or a
single internal RAM board in the 400.  The 400 was designed to support up to
32KiB RAM; the 800 up to 48KiB RAM.  Of the remaining 16KiB of the total 64KiB
of 8-bit address space available to use with the 6502 and ANTIC, 8KiB is taken
up by the Operating System, 2KiB is occupied by the Math Pack, 2KiB is
occupied by hardware registers, and 4KiB was unused/reserved for future use.
Use of an 8KiB ROM cartridge limits the total available system RAM to 40KiB;
use of a 16KiB cartridge, or two 8KiB cartridges in an 800, limits the total
available system RAM to 32KiB.

  internal RAM slot, or in either of the first two RAM slots in the 800.  In
  the 800 a 32KiB board must be installed in combination with an 8KiB or
  16KiB board also in slot 1 or 2, or utilize another solution that taps both
  slots for the necessary chip select lines.

     Steven P. Davies
   - Atari 48K RAM Expansion Kit (400) (June 1983)
- 52KiB boards/upgrades
  These have the same features/capabilities as 48KiB boards/upgrades but make
  an additional 4KiB available to the computer in the 4KiB of memory address
  space (49152-53247 or $C000-$CFFF), unused by the 400/800 hardware or
  Operating System, directly beyond the normal 48KiB RAM address range.  The
  result is 52KiB of continuous, non-banked RAM available while still running
  the standard 400/800 OS in memory as well.
   - Tiny Tek 48K/52K (400)
   - Newell 48/52K Ram Board (400 or 800)
   - Xtra HardWare XTRA52 (400 or 800)
   - The Gap, by Computer Support (48KiB 400 or 48KiB 800).  Adds 4KiB.
- 64KiB and up boards/upgrades
  Surpassing the limit of 52KiB continuous RAM address space available in the
  400/800 requires a memory-banking scheme for using software-selectable
  memory banks that share a range of memory addresses within the normal 52KiB
  RAM address range.  Atari never offered such a solution, but several
  different third-party schemes emerged.
 &gt; "Axlon" bank-selection type
  Banks are 16KiB, visible at 16384-32767 ($4000-$7FFF).  Bank selection is
  controlled by writing a bank number to ANY address in the ranges 4032-4095
  ($0FC0-$0FFF) (mirror) OR 53184-53247 ($CFC0-$CFFF) (latter range
  recommended by Axlon; byte 53247 ($CFFF) used by popular convention).
  A value of 0 selects the main/normal bank, and values from 1 to 255 select
  an extended bank.  Scheme supports up to 4080KiB of banked RAM (255 banks of
  16KiB each) for a total system RAM potential of 4128KiB (4080KiB + 48KiB).
   - Axlon RAMDISK 128K Memory System / Rampower 128 (1981)
     (800 middle RAM slot).  Provides 8 16KiB banks of memory, one of which is
     available to the computer at a time as part of the normal RAM of up to
     48KiB.  With a total of 32KiB installed in the other two RAM slots, the
     total system potential is 160KiB RAM.  Can provide a 112KiB RAMdisk.
      - Shipped with CREATE utility that modifies Atari DOS 2.0S into:
        Axlon RAMDisk MMS V1.0 (Memory Management System) (D4: RAMdisk)
      - First 3rd-party DOS with Axlon RAMdisk: ADS Integrater/smallDOS (1983)
   - Magna Systems Ramcharger 256K (800 middle RAM slot)(1986)
     Provides 16 16KiB banks of memory, one of which is available to the
     computer at a time as part of the normal RAM of up to 48KiB.  With a
     total of 32KiB installed in the other two RAM slots, the total system
     potential is 288KiB.  Can provide a 240KiB RAMdisk.
   - Magna Systems Ramcharger 512K (800 middle RAM slot)(1986)
     Provides 32 16KiB banks of memory, one of which is available to the
     computer at a time as part of the normal RAM of up to 48KiB.  With a
     total of 32KiB installed in the other two RAM slots, the total system
     potential is 544KiB.  Can provide a 496KiB RAMdisk.
   - Magna Systems Ramcharger 1Mb (800 middle RAM slot)(1986)
     Provides 64 16KiB banks of memory, one of which is available to the
     computer at a time as part of the normal RAM of up to 48KiB.  With a
     total of 32KiB installed in the other two RAM slots, the total system
     potential is 1056KiB.  Can provide a 1008KiB RAMdisk.
 &gt; "Mosaic" bank-selection type
  Banks are 4KiB, visible at 49152-53247 or $C000-$CFFF.  Writes to 65472-
  65507 or $FFC0-$FFE3 enable specific banks (65472 or $FFC0 = bank 0, 65473
  or $FFC1 = bank 1, etc.).  Writes to 65280-65471 or $FF00-$FFBF, or to
  65508-65535 or $FFE4-$FFFF, disable all banks.  Scheme supports 36 banks,
  for a total system potential of 192KiB (48KiB + 36 banks of 4KiB).
   - Mosaic 64K Ram Select (400 or 800 any RAM slot) (400/800 version or early
     400-only version) (1982)
      - Single board provides 48KiB "hard-wired" plus 4 banks of 4KiB
        addressed directly beyond the normal 48KiB limit, for 52KiB of
        continuous memory available to the computer.
      - In the 800, may be used in combinations including two 16KiB boards,
        one 32KiB board, one 16KiB board and one 32KiB board, or with one or
        two additional Mosaic 64K Ram Select boards (total of 10 possible
        configurations).  Each 64K Ram Select allows the computer to see all
        the memory of the other boards, makes enough of its own memory
        available to the computer to reach the continuous RAM limit of 52K,
        and makes the rest of its memory available to the computer in banks of
        4KiB addressed directly beyond the normal 48KiB limit.  Total system
        potential with three 64K Ram Select boards is 192KiB (48KiB + 36 banks
        of 4KiB).
      - Cable Kit/Cable Connectors #1 required in 400 or with first 64K Ram 
        Select in 800; Cable Kit/Cable Connectors #2 required with 2nd or 3rd
        64K Ram Select in 800; use of one 64K Ram board with one 32KiB board
        requires Companion Board in middle RAM slot in 800
      - 48K Boot Fix program included for compatibility with software written
        to treat more than 48KiB available as not enough memory available.
      - Software sold separately by Mosaic:
         - Handyman by Holiday Software (software utility package; routines 
           reside in bank select RAM; useable with BASIC and Assembler Editor)

            - GENVDOS installation program modifies Atari DOS 2.0S to support
              a Mosaic RAMdisk, and to support DUP.SYS and/or MEM.SAV residing
              on the RAMdisk.

     (Michigan Atari Computer Enthusiasts), 9/82, including "Suggestions for a
     64K Modification" ("MACE Mod")
     Provides one 16KiB bank of memory, bank-switched with the "middle" 16KiB
     of the 48KiB RAM, visible at 16384-32767 or $4000-$7FFF, for a system
     total of 64KiB RAM.  Write a 1 to a memory location between $D700 and
     $D7FF (55040 to 55295 decimal; byte 55295 ($D7FF) used by popular
     convention) to enable the banked memory; write a 0 to the same location
     to disable banked memory.
   - Atari 800 Plus 256K, project by David G. Byrd
     48KiB of normal user memory and 240KiB of "extended memory".  Uses the
     $4000-$7FFF banked region, with bank selection at $D7xx (byte 55295
     ($D7FF) used by popular convention).  Versions:

XL/XE Memory Upgrades
---------------------
In Atari XL/XE computers, the available 64KiB of memory address space includes
48KiB of "main" RAM addresses (analogous to the 400/800 design maximum,
including 8KiB or 16KiB of address space occupied by any ROM cartridge
present), and there is an additional 14KiB RAM available in the same 14KiB of
address space as the 12KiB XL OS and the 2KiB Math Pack.  In the 130XE, there
are four "extra" 16KiB RAM banks that can be accessed using the "middle" 16KiB
of main memory address space (analogous to the middle RAM slot in the 800).
Memory location 54017 ($D301), known as PIA Port B or PORTB, is used by the
programmer to manage access to portions of built-in ROM and RAM that share
ranges of memory addresses:
  Bit  Meaning if value set to 1
  ---  -------------------------
  #0   OS ROM enabled / RAM disabled (16KiB, 49152-65535 or $C000-$FFFF,
       except 2KiB range of hardware addresses, 53248-55295 or $D000-$D7FF)
  #1   BASIC ROM disabled / RAM enabled (8KiB, 40960-49151 or $A000-$BFFF)
  #2   1200XL LED 1 off; 130XE bank selection least significant bit (LSB)
  #3   1200XL LED 2 off; 130XE bank selection most significant bit (MSB)
  #4   130XE CPU Bank /Enable (CBE) (1=disabled, 0=enabled)
       (16KiB, 16384-32767 or $4000-$7FFF)
  #5   130XE Video Bank /Enable (VBE) (1=disabled, 0=enabled)
       (16KiB, 16384-32767 or $4000-$7FFF)
  #6   XE System Console Missile Command disabled / RAM enabled
       (8KiB, 40960-49151 or $A000-$BFFF)
  #7   Self Test ROM disabled / RAM enabled (2KiB, 20480-22527 or $5000-$57FF)

XL/XE memory upgrades to more than 128KiB RAM use additional PORTB bits as
bank-selection bits, beyond the two (bits 2-3) used in the 130XE.  "True ANTIC
banking" describes the ability, as in the 130XE, for the 6502, ANTIC, both, or
neither, to access the currently-selected bank of "extra" memory, based on the
settings of PORTB bits 4-5 (CBE and VBE).

------------------------------

Subject: 7.1.1) What is the Atari Operating System?

"An operating system (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer
hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs.  The
operating system is a vital component of the system software in a computer
system.  Application programs require an operating system to function."
(Wikipedia 8/15/2012)

Atari 8-bit computers were supplied with the proprietary Atari Operating
System contained in Read Only Memory (ROM) as an integral feature of the
computer.  Major design elements of the Atari OS (derived here from De Re
Atari):

  MONITOR
  Executed upon system power (Coldstart) or [System Reset] keypress
  (Warmstart).  Sets up memory management, initializes I/O Subsystem, sets up
  System Vectors, boots (loads software into RAM) from cassette or diskette if
  present, selects and launches program execution environment

  INTERRUPT PROCESSING STRUCTURE
  The OS processes 6502 interrupts as generated by events including: keyboard
  keystrokes, the [Break] key, some serial bus events, system timer timeouts,
  and the vertical blank interval on the television/monitor.  An Interrupt
  ReQuest (IRQ) Handler and a NonMaskable Interrupt (NMI) Handler are both
  provided.

  SYSTEM VECTORS
  Design consideration allows for:
   - User programs to directly utilize OS routines
   - User programs to substitute for OS routines

  INPUT/OUTPUT SUBSYSTEM
  Multi-layered provision for user program access to hardware peripherals.
  Device Handlers may be added by user programs.  Includes a complete Cassette
  Handler and a rudimentary Diskette Handler, but notably does not include a
  complete Disk Operating System.  Described in greater detail in a separate
  section of this FAQ list.

  REAL TIME PROGRAMMING
  Hardware timers and system software timers are provided to facilitate
  predictable and controllable speeds of software routine execution.

  ROM CHARACTER SET
  Atari ASCII, or ATASCII.  May be substituted by user programs.  Described in
  greater detail in a separate section of this FAQ list.

  FLOATING POINT PACKAGE (FPP)
  Set of mathematical routines that use binary coded decimal (BCD) arithmetic
  to provide standard mathematical functions (+, -, *, /), exponential and
  logarithmic functions as well as conversion from ATASCII to BCD and BCD to
  ATASCII.  Developed apart from the rest of the Atari OS by Shepardson
  Microsystems, Inc. (SMI) for internal use by Atari BASIC, but placed in
  operating system ROM by Atari for universal availability.

In the Atari 800 only, the Operating System is contained on the Personality
Board found in the plug-in CX801 10K ROM Personality Module.  The modular
design allows the user to easily upgrade or replace the OS by replacing the
Personality Module.  Atari themselves never offered upgrades or replacements
for the CX801.

In all other 8-bit Atari computer models the OS ROM is contained on one or
more chips inside the machine, and was not intended to be upgraded or replaced
by users.  Thus, revised versions of the Atari OS were not offered as upgrades
for existing machines, but rather as built-in features of new-production
computers.

Software can reliably determine the version of the Atari Operating System
running as follows. (primary source: OS Manual XL Addendum, p.28) 

First, determine whether the system is running a 400/800 OS version or an
XL OS version by checking the value of memory location $FCD8.  In Atari
BASIC, PEEK(64728) is the equivalent test.
     Read Result   Means
     $A2 (162)     400/800 OS
     $4C (76)      XL OS

Then, if running a 400/800 OS version as determined above, now check the
values of BOTH memory locations $FFF8 and $FFF9.  In Atari BASIC, PEEK(65528)
and also PEEK(65529) and interpret the results as follows:
 $FFF8 (65528)   $FFF9 (65529)    400/800 OS Rev.       Rev. Date
 -------------   -------------    ---------------       ---------
   $FF (255)          n/a     --&gt; Operating System 255  1979-04 (VERY RARE)
 A pre-production demo unit release, possibly a few thousand once existed.

------------------------------

Subject: 7.1.2) What other operating systems have been produced for the Atari?

This section started by Arianne Slaager (Alphasys).

Args OS 3 CRC32: 0x5B1EADF3
- Mostly a copy of the REV 2 XL rom, but boasts a ROM disk driver by Ralf
David that activates by holding Select while resetting.  How this works, I
have no clue.  ARGS stands for Atari Regional Gruppe Stuttgart.  Need extra
info on this one.

Bibomon V2.1 (c) 1084/85 E. Reuss CRC32: 0x41B80C28
- Option + Reset enters a built in machine language monitor.  Also some colors
have changed.  Looks like BASIC is disabled by default, and no way to enable
it.

Highchip (c) Irata GmbH 1985 V.1.9 CRC32: 0x41BB4047
- Mostly a copy of REV 2 XL rom, but includes Happy Warp Speed boot and
changed colors.  Special options menu can be initialised by pressing Option +
Select + Reset.  Pressing Select + Start while booting, boots from casette.
Booting while holding Start tries to initialise Warp speed before booting.

Oldruner CRC32: 0x10ABFD80
- A copy of the OS-B for the 800, but tweaked to function with the XL/XE line
of computers.  Makes the XL/XE line able to run 400/800 software.

Omnimon 87 CRC32: 0x9B4F8FAD
- Byte Eaters OMNIMON V_r 1987: Added monitor, through Select+Reset, which
replaced the self test, as was pretty much the standard at the time.
Compatible with most 800 software.  Classified as translator rom.
 
Omnimon XL CRC32: 0xBFA09B66
- David Young OMNIMONXL (C)1984: Added monitor, through Select+Reset, which
replaced the self test, as was pretty much the standard at the time.
Compatible with most 800 software.  Classified as translator rom.

Omnimon XE CRC32: 0x64B77137
- David Young OMNIMONXL (C)1984: Added monitor, through Select+Reset, which
replaced the self test, as was pretty much the standard at the time.
Compatible with most 800 software.  Classified as translator rom.

Omniview 5 CRC32: 0x5987F5D8
- (c) 1985 David Young.  Based on rev B 800 rom.  The extra 6KiB holds the
main feature: A 80 column E: handler that can be invoked from most programs
including BASIC.  This mode uses a Graphics 8 screen, with a 4-bit wide font.
Not the best readability.  Manual includes patches for (at the time) well 
known word processor software: Speedscript 3.0.

Omniview 6 256KiB CRC32: 0xEB0C62EB
- Only difference with Omniview 5 is a change of tagline.  David Young tagline
is replaced by the message "    OS-80+ ext.256K rev.(C)1986".  There is no
extra support for additional ram.  I suspect it's a rip-off.

Omniview XE CRC32: 0xE4BF5B98
- (c) 1985 David Young.  Very alike Omniview 5.  Same base, same feature, but
with a reworked character set, which is a slight bit easier on the eyes.
Minor changes in the code.

Pud CRC32: 0x95EC9329
- Proof of concept rom for a Power-Up display, made by Aegaeis Softscape.
There might be many versions of this now, because it was advertised to sell,
tailored to suit anyone with a name to stick in.  Has no Self Test, since that
area is replaced with custom graphics/routines for the power-up display.
Based on XE rom.  Fully compatible. 
- If booted with Select, the startup screen will be skipped.  If left by its
own devices, the startup screen will show for about 2.5 seconds.  If Select is
pressed in that time short time, it'll continue to show until Select is 
released again.

Q-Meg V2 CRC32: 0x51939D37
- Q-Meg OS versions incorporate a Machine language monitor, support for
ramdisks, including BOOTING from them, without the need for a separate ramdisk
driver.  HIO (high speed SIO for Speedy extended drives) is built in aswell.
- Compatible with the XL/XE roms for normal use.  Not recommended for 
emulators for all versions.
- Lower versions can adress drive 1-4 and 8, later ones can adress drive 1-8.
Configurable ramdisks with 256KiB of memory can be either 2 single density
drives, 1 enhanced drive + one small x-drive, or one double density drive.
- Ramdisks may be filled from disk directly from the menu, aswell as written
to disk, including formatting.  They can also be protected from being
overwritten by other software.  Also BASIC can be turned on/off.

Q-Meg V2.3 CRC32: 0xA1FB9BFA
Q-Meg V3.0 CRC32: 0xBE14E47E
Q-Meg V3.2 CRC32: 0x8CD48719
Q-Meg V3.8 CRC32: 0x78F2C102
Q-Meg V4.2 CRC32: 0x64CCFC53
Q-Meg V4.3 CRC32: 0xBE2442DA
Q-Meg V4.4 CRC32: 0x0547F499

Speedos CRC32: 0xA991769B
- I totally have no clue what this does, it just makes my computer crash like
there's no tomorrow.  I get the feeling this has Happy extensions that my
drives just don't like, or something like that...

Supermon '85 CRC32: 0xBBD8A8BD
- All Supermon versions are based on the 800 rom, as far as I've noticed so
far.
- Machine language monitor through Select+Reset.

Supermon 2.0 CRC32: 0xFFDC4372
- This one is probably a rip off of the '86 version, as only the monitor
tagline differs.

Supermon '86 (BRD) CRC32: 0x28DD9BE4
- Same as Supermon 2.0, just gives a german header when invoking the monitor.

Supermon HTT CRC32: 0x1101FF93
- Same as Supermon '85, with different colors and charset.  Modified build for
the High-Tech Team, a demo/developer group from the Netherlands.

Warpcopy CRC32: 0x21A89311
- Warp speed Happy extension included.  Need extra info on this one.

Xos CRC32: 0x196C9B00
- Never found out how to get into special functions on this one yet.  Need
extra info on this one.

Subject: 7.1.3) What is the ATASCII character set?

ASCII is an acronym for the American Standard Code for Information
Interchange.  Pronounced ask-ee, ASCII is a code for representing English
characters as numbers, with each letter assigned a number from 0 to 127.  For
example, the ASCII code for uppercase M is 77.  Most computers use ASCII codes
to represent text, which makes it possible to transfer data from one computer
to another.

The 8-bit Atari computers use a modified version of the ASCII character set
called Atari ASCII, or ATASCII.  The character set is provided as part of the
Operating System.

David Moeser produced this nice translation table.

Subject: 7.1.4) How can my program detect keypresses directly?

modified slightly from text by JB in Atari Customer Service Demopac #3, 5/82

For reading keypresses of most keys on the Atari keyboard, one can look
directly at the memory location where the keycode for the last key pressed is
stored.

To read directly from the keyboard buffer, check the value of memory location
CH (decimal 764; hex $2FC).  This location returns a keycode, rather than a
letter or ATASCII value.  The keycode is an arbitrary code which is unique for
each key.  It reflects whether SHIFT or CONTROL is pressed, and in some cases
whether SHIFT and CONTROL are both pressed.  If you use this method, you must
translate the keycode in your own program.  There is a translation table on
page 50 of the Operating System User's Manual, or you can PEEK the location
and create your own table.  This method is useful if you are simply checking
for a particular keypress, i.e. PRESS "C" TO CONTINUE.  The Atari BASIC
program code for this would be:
     10 PRINT "PRESS C TO CONTINUE"
     20 If PEEK(764)&lt;&gt;18 THEN GOTO 20
Checking CH, the keyboard buffer, bypasses the K: keyboard handler altogether.
A disadvantage is that you have to interpret the keycode yourself.  An
advantage is that you don't have to press RETURN, and in bypassing the
handler, you also bypass the keyboard beep.

------------------------------

Subject: 7.1.5) How is the Input/Output subsystem of the Atari OS organized?

Derived primarily from the Operating System User's Manual and De Re Atari.

The Input/Output (I/O) subsystem of the Atari Operating System (OS) comprises
a collection of software utilities/routines, offered at three different levels
of abstraction (CIO, Device Handlers, SIO), that allow for user communication
with local system and peripheral devices.  Communications between adjacent
levels of the I/O subsystem are carried via one of the three types of I/O
system control blocks (IOCB, ZIOCB, DCB).

Presented in order from the highest level to the lowest level:

USER PROGRAM

INPUT/OUTPUT CONTROL BLOCK (IOCB)
Carries communications between a user program and Central I/O (CIO)
 - 8 IOCBs (#0-#7) are provided by the OS.  
 - Each IOCB can be assigned to control any device/file.
 - IOCB #0 is assigned by the OS to the E: Screen Editor at power-up and
   system reset.
 - Software programming environments may reserve other IOCBs for internal
   use.  For example, Atari BASIC uses IOCB #6 to interact with the S:
   device when using graphics modes other than zero, and uses IOCB #7 for
   I/O with the printer, disk drive, and cassette.  (Patchett/Sherer,
   Master Memory Map, <a href=http://www.atariarchives.org/mmm/iocbs.php>http://www.atariarchives.org/mmm/iocbs.php</a>)

CENTRAL I/O (CIO) utility/routine
Intended for user program access to system and peripheral devices.  A device
consists of one or more "files" where each file consists of a sequential
collection of data bytes.  Files are optionally organized into "records" which
are delineated by the End Of Line character/byte ($9B).  8 basic functions
provided by CIO: OPEN, CLOSE, GET CHARACTERS, PUT CHARACTERS, GET RECORD,
PUT RECORD, GET STATUS, Special (handler-specific)
Additional CIO features:
 - Device independence
    - Single entry point for all devices (and for all operations)
    - Device-independent calling sequence
    - Uniform rules for data transfers, regardless of actual device storage
      block sizes
 - Data access methods
    - Byte-aligned.  Any number of bytes can be read or written, and the
      next operation will continue where the prior one left off.
    - Record-aligned.  A single record of bytes can be read or written, and
      the next operation will continue at the beginning of the next record.
 - Multiple device/file concurrency
    - Up to 8 device/files can be accessed concurrently, each operating
      independently of the others.
 - Unified error handling
 - Device expansion: while the OS supplies several device handlers in ROM,
   CIO also supports the loading of additional CIO-compatible device
   handlers into RAM.

ZERO-PAGE I/O CONTROL BLOCK (ZIOCB)
Carries communications between higher-level CIO and lower-level device
handlers.  There is a single ZIOCB only.

DEVICE HANDLERS
Device-specific communication.  Handlers provided by the Atari OS:
 - K: Keyboard Handler (read only)
 - S: Display Handler (read/write)
      Offers the special CIO commands DRAW and FILL.
 - E: Screen Editor (read/write)
    - Uses the K: Keyboard Handler and the S: Display Handler to provide 
      "line-at-a-time" input with interactive editing functions, as well as
      formatted output.
 - C: Cassette Handler (read/write)
 - P: Printer (write only)
    - 400/800 OS: Supports a single printer device; any
      device number is ignored.  All powered printers attached via SIO or
      the 850 parallel port respond to all print commands.
    - XL OS: Supports 8 different printer devices: P1:-P8:
      P: (no device number) is interpreted to mean: P1:
      Printer devices are associated with specific models of Atari printers as 
      follows:
        P1: All printers attached via SIO or the 850 parallel port
        P2: 850 Interface Module parallel port (e.g., Atari 825)
        P3: 1025 Printer
        P4: 1020 Color Plotter
        P5: 1027 Printer
        P6: 1029 Printer
        P7: XMM801 Printer
        P8: XDM121 Printer
      Tomasz Krasuski contributes (May 2011):
        This feature is buggy in XL OS Rev.A/Rev.B/Rev.1.  Behavior was
        fixed to reliable operation as of XL OS Rev.2.
 - Diskette Handler, Resident
    - Not a full device handler; not CIO-compatible
    - Except for Atari DOS I, normally only used to load a full File
      Management System from disk
Nonresident Handlers can be added to the system environment in several ways:
 - Loaded from diskette or cassette
 - Loaded from the ROM of an SIO device (850 interface, 1030 modem).  May be
   loaded at system startup without disk drive, may be loaded as part of a 
   Disk Boot, or may be loaded afterward.
 - XL OS Rev.1+: Loaded from a New Device attached via PBI or Cartridge+ECI

DEVICE CONTROL BLOCK (DCB)
Carries communications between higher-level device handlers and lower-level
Serial I/O (SIO).  There is a single DCB only.
 - Also used by the OS-resident Diskette Handler

SERIAL I/O (SIO) utility/routine
Low-level communication with serial bus peripherals
 - Control of all Serial bus I/O, conforming to the bus protocol
 - Bus operation retries on errors
 - Return of unified error statuses on error conditions
 - Used by the OS-resident P: handler
 - Not used by the OS-resident K: S: and E: handlers (non-SIO devices)
 - While the the OS-resident C: handler uses the SIO bus hardware, it does not
   use the SIO utility/routine.

Any lower level (lower than CIO) access to a device by a user program involves
the direct reading and writing of the hardware registers associated with the
device.

Subject: 7.1.6) What is attract mode?

From the Atari Operating System User's Manual p. 215:

  Attract mode is a mechanism that protects the television screen from having
  patterns "burned into" the phosphors due to a fixed display being left on
  the screen for extended periods of time.  When the computer is left
  unattended for more than 9 minutes, the color intensities are limited to 50
  percent of maximum and the hues are continually varied every 8.3 seconds.
  Pressing any keyboard data key will be sufficient to remove the attract mode
  for 9 more minutes.

Laurent Delsarte contributes:

  To launch the attract mode from BASIC, use a "POKE 77,128"
  To disable the attract mode from BASIC, use a "POKE 77,0"

------------------------------

Subject: 7.1.7) What is the Atari cassette utilization/filesystem?

(Section sources include: De Re Atari, OS Users Manual, XL Addendum)

The following are characteristics of the cassette utilization/filesystem
as implemented by the Atari Operating System.

 - Mark = 5327Hz (audible sound frequency)
 - Space = 3995Hz (audible sound frequency)
 - Bit = space(0) or mark(1)
 - Byte = 10 bits:
    - 1 start bit (space)
    - 8 data bits 
    - 1 stop bit (mark)
 - Record = 132 bytes:
    - 1st Marker byte for tape speed measurement = $55 (hex)
    - 2nd Marker byte for tape speed measurement = $55 (hex)
    - 1 Control byte
    - 128 Data bytes
       - Read at baud rate derived from the record's tape speed measurement.
         Input baud rates ranging from 318 to 1407 can theoretically be
         handled. (De Re Atari C-3)
    - 1 Checksum byte.  One of three values:
       1) $FC = record is a full data record (128 bytes)
       2) $FA = record is a partial data record, and the next record should
                be an end-of-file record.  The actual number of data bytes
                (1-127) is stored in the last (128th) data byte.
       3) $FE = record is an end-of-file record.  This is followed by 128
                zero bytes
 - Pre-Record Write Tone (PRWT) = pure mark tone
 - Post-Record Gap (PRG)
 - Record Frame = PRWT + Record + PRG
 - Inter-Record Gap (IRG) = PRG + PRWT
 - Normal IRG Mode: Tape comes to stop after each record frame
 - Short IRG Mode: Tape is not stopped between record frames.  
   (Short IRG Mode is supported by the Atari BASIC commands CSAVE and CLOAD.)
 - Normal IRG PRWT = 3 seconds of mark tone
 - Short IRG PRWT = 0.25 second of mark tone
 - Normal IRG PRG = Up to 1 second of unknown tones (motor stop/start time)
 - Short IRG PRG = pure mark tone, duration set by user program (may be zero)
 - File consists of:
    1) 20-second leader of mark tone
    2) Any number of record frames
    3) End-Of-File record frame
 - Files are written in fixed-length blocks at 600 baud (physical bits/second)

Thomas Richter contributes the following (16 Jan 2004):

There are a couple of reasons why some games don't run on the XL/XE
models.  I try to order them by "likeliness", of course biased by my
personal observations:

i) The printer buffer of the XL Operating System in page 3 is a couple
of bytes shorter.  The additional bytes are used for extended OS
variables not available in the 800 series.  Most prominent is the $3FA
location, holding a shadow register of GTIA's TRIG3 signal.  While a
true joystick trigger line in the 400/800 series, this signal is used
as "cartridge inserted" signal for XL/XE models.  Unfortunately, the OS
compares GTIA TRIG3 with the shadow register at $3FA in each vertical
blank, running into an endless loop if the register contents don't
match.  This causes hangs for games using page 3 either as copy-buffer
or for player-missile graphics.  (Hangs by Ms. Pac-Man and
Bacterion! are caused by this, and many others...)  This is "fixable"
either by the translator disk, or by a quick hack into the game,
replacing the OS vertical blank or poking TRIG3 frequently into its
shadow.  The reason for the OS behavior might be that Atari wanted to
prevent crashes if the cartridge is inserted or removed while the
machine is running.  The 400/800 is powered down when a cartridge is
inserted, the XL/XE lacks the cover of the older models that triggered
a little switch to interrupt the power line.

ii) Similar to the above, writes to $3f8.  This OS equate defines
whether on a warm start, the BASIC ROM shall be mapped back in.  If
its contents are altered, a program triggering a reset as part of its
initialization will find itself then with 8KiB less RAM occupied by
a BASIC ROM, making it crash.  Similarly, writes to the cartridge checksum
$3eb could cause a cold-start on a "reset initialization".  This is
fixable by the translator disk.

iii) Some games use a four-joystick setup, or at least initialize
PIA itself.  If this happens inadequately, PIA Port B, bit 0 gets changed,
disabling the ROM, and thus crashing the machine.  This is not fixable
by the translator since it is a hardware issue.

iv) Direct jumps into the OS ROM, not using the documented vectors in
the $e450 area.  Interestingly, this fault is not as common as it may
sound since games hardly ever use the OS.  It causes failures of
some "serious applications", most notably "QS Forth" and applications
compiled by it.  This is fixable by the translator disk.

Subject: 7.1.9) Why do some programs run only on the XL/XE (not the 400/800)?

Konrad M.Kokoszkiewicz writes: 

XL/XE software won't work on 400/800 if: 
 
1) It uses shadow RAM at $C000-$CFFF and $D800-$FFFF 
2) It uses RAM expansions at $4000-$7FFF controlled by PORTB $D301 
3) It uses specific XL OS functions (like JNEWDEVC) 
4) It uses illegal XL OS addresses. 
5) It uses European Charset :) 

------------------------------

Subject: 7.1.10) How can I run older programs using the Atari Translator?

While each later revision of the Atari Operating System (OS) was designed to
be backward compatible with earlier versions, software incompatibilities were
sometimes introduced.  In particular, a number of programs written for the
400/800 OS versions do not run correctly or at all under the XL OS
versions.  In order to allow many "400/800-only" programs to be run on an
XL (or later, XE) computer, Atari sold the Atari Translator on disk.

The auto-booting Translator diskette installs the 400/800 OS in RAM "under"
the ROM-based XL OS in an XL/XE Atari computer.  Once this disk has been
loaded, the user is prompted to remove it and insert the application diskette
(or cassette) and press the [SELECT] key.  When this occurs the system
undertakes a COLD START in the new, RAM-based 400/800 OS environment.

The Translator disk is a two-sided disk, providing two slightly different
versions of the Translator.  The Side A Translator provides a version of the
400/800 OS that is slightly modified to allow the [RESET] key to be pressed
without reverting to the XL OS on ROM.  The Side B Translator provides an
even higher degree of compatibility, including support for programs that boot
the 850 interface, but the 400/800 OS in RAM would be disabled if the [RESET]
key is pressed.

Atari shipped two versions of the Translator disk:
 - Atari Translator DX5063 NTSC version:  400/800 OS Rev.B/NTSC
 - Atari Translator FK100807 PAL version: 400/800 OS Rev.A/PAL

Translator programmers at Atari:
 - Greg Riker:  Original version 83-03-20
 - Joe Miller:  Added graphics and code for [RESET] 83-09-15

Subject: 7.2.1) What is Atari BASIC?

(Thanks to Laurent Delsarte for cartridge variation pics and testing.)

BASIC is an acronym for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code.
Developed by John Kemeney and Thomas Kurtz in the mid 1960s at Dartmouth
College, BASIC is one of the earliest and simplest high-level programming
languages, incorporating components of FORTRAN and ALGOL.

In October 1978 Atari contracted with Shepardson Microsystems, Inc. (SMI;
headed by Bob Shepardson) to create a version of BASIC (as well as a File
Management System) for the upcoming Atari personal computers.  Credits:
  Paul Laughton    - Main programmer (also wrote: FMS for DOS I and DOS 2.0S)
  Kathleen O'Brien - Floating point routines (also wrote: Assembler Editor)
  Bill Wilkinson   - Preliminary specifications for the language;
                     floating point scheme design
  Paul Krasno      - Implemented the transcendental routines

While SMI developed Atari BASIC to occupy 10KiB of ROM, including a 2KiB
Floating Point Package (FPP) for internal use by the language, Atari placed
the FPP component in operating system ROM (memory locations 55296 to 57343 or
$D800 to $DFFF) for universal availability.  Thus, the Atari BASIC ROM was
slimmed to 8KiB.  Please see the "What is the Atari OS" section of this FAQ
for further information about the FPP.

Atari released 3 different Revisions of Atari BASIC:

Revision A
----------
- Shipped with the 400 computer systems from 1979-1981
- Shipped with the 800 computer systems from 1979-1982

Atari BASIC Rev. A was produced by Atari on cartridge (CXL4002), standard
400/800-style brown label, which reads either "BASIC Computer Program" (early)
or "BASIC Computing Language" (most).

The cartridge was produced in mass quantities before SMI had finished
debugging it.  One place these bugs are documented is in this article by Steve
Hanson from Compute! magazine, Oct. 1981:
<a href=http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue17/171_1_DOCUMENTED_ATARI_BUGS.php>http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue17/171_1_DOCUMENTED_ATARI_BUGS.php</a>

On February 25, 1981, the source code to Atari BASIC (including the FPP) was
purchased from SMI by Optimized Systems Software (OSS), headed by former SMI
employees Bill Wilkinson and Mike Peters.

The Atari BASIC Source Book (Compute! Books, 1983, 0-942386-15-9), authored by
Bill Wilkinson, Kathleen O'Brien and Paul Laughton, made the source code to
Atari BASIC (Rev. A; and including the FPP) available to the public.

When the 600XL/800XL computers shipped in the fall of 1983 they included a
newly debugged Atari BASIC Rev. B built-in on ROM.  Unfortunately, while most
existing bugs were fixed, Rev. B introduced a new bug more serious than any of
the earlier problems.  In his article in the June 1985 issue of Compute!, Bill
Wilkinson writes:
  Each time you LOAD (or CLOAD or RUN "filename") a program, rev B adds 16
  bytes to the size of your program.  If you then save the program, the next
  time you load it in it grows by ANOTHER 16 bytes, and so on.

The problem can be alleviated by periodically, if not exclusively, using
LIST instead of SAVE or CSAVE to save your programs.

Atari never produced Atari BASIC Rev. B on cartridge.

"Revision C Converter: Type-in fix for buggy BASIC revision B" by Matthew
Ratcliff was published in the September 1985 issue of Antic:

Revision C
----------
Atari BASIC Rev. C is the final "fully debugged" version.  Rev. C was first
shipped on cartridge (CXL4002) by Atari, Inc. in June 1984 according to Antic
(<a href=http://www.atarimagazines.com/v4n5/revisioncconverter.html>http://www.atarimagazines.com/v4n5/revisioncconverter.html</a>).  The silver
label on the first Rev. C cartridges reads "(c)1982 Atari, Inc." and "Made in
U.S.A."  Atari, Corp. also produced Rev. C on cartridge, using two different
silver labels designs, both of which read "(c)1985 Atari Corp." and "Made in
Taiwan".  Rev. C was also built-in on ROM in late-production 800XL computers
as well as the 65XE, the 130XE, the XE System Console, and the 800XE.

Determining Revision version
----------------------------
When running Atari BASIC, memory location 43234 ($A8E2, BASIC ROM) indicates
which Revision of BASIC is running.  At the READY prompt, enter:
     ? PEEK(43234)

If the result is:  You have Revision:       Atari Part#:
     162                  A                 C012402+C014502 
     96                   B                 C060302A 
     234                  C                 C024947A

Subject: 7.2.2) How do I run a program from cassette, or save to cassette?

To load and run an Atari BASIC program from cassette:
1. Insert the cassette into the recorder.
2. Use REWIND or ADVANCE/F.FWD on the recorder, if necessary, to bring the
   tape to the position where the program is located.
3. Boot the computer to the Atari BASIC READY prompt.
4. There are several possibilities for the next step, depending on how the
   program was saved, and whether you want to run the program or just load
   it into RAM.  Enter one of the following four commands:
   a. CLOAD                       loads programs saved with CSAVE
   b. LOAD "C:"                   loads programs saved with SAVE "C:"
   c. ENTER "C:"                  loads programs saved with LIST "C:"
   d. RUN "C:"                    loads and runs programs saved with SAVE "C:"
5. The system buzzer sounds (to signal you to press PLAY on the recorder).
6. Press PLAY on the recorder.
7. Press the RETURN key on the computer keyboard.
   Tape motion starts, the program loads from the cassette into RAM, and then
   tape motion stops.
   Then, if you entered RUN "C:" above, the loaded program runs; otherwise a
   READY prompt is displayed.
7. You may press STOP on the recorder once the program is loaded, unless the
   program is designed to control further tape motion start/stop.
8. If the loaded program is not running yet (you did not enter RUN "C:"
   above), now enter the command: RUN

To save an Atari BASIC program from computer RAM to cassette:
1. Insert a cassette into the recorder.
2. Use REWIND or ADVANCE/F.FWD on the recorder, if necessary, to bring the
   tape to the position where the program is to be recorded.
3. Enter one of the following three commands:
   a. CSAVE 
      (short inter-record gap - fastest read/write speed - tokenized files)
   b. SAVE "C:" 
      (long inter-record gap - middle read/write speed - tokenized files)
   c. LIST "C:" 
      (long inter-record gap - slowest read/write speeds - straight ATASCII -
       tape actually stops in between block reads/writes)
4. The system buzzer sounds twice (to signal you to press both PLAY and
   RECORD on the recorder).
5. Press both PLAY and RECORD on the recorder.
6. Press the RETURN key on the computer keyboard.
   Tape motion starts, the program is copied from RAM to the cassette, and
   then tape motion stops.
7. You may press STOP on the recorder once recording has finished.

Subject: 7.3.1) What is Atari DOS, and what versions did Atari release?

This FAQ section describes the various DOS versions produced by Atari for use
with their 8-bit computers: DOS I, DOS 2.0S, DOS 3, DOS 2.5, DOS XE, DOS XLE

On the Atari, a complete Disk Operating System (DOS) consists of a complex,
flexible combination of software components provided in the Atari OS on ROM
with software components loaded into RAM from disk:

  1) SIO (Serial I/O bus Utility) routine
      - Component of the Atari OS
      - Generalized low level communications with SIO bus devices, including
        disk drives
      - Utilized by the Resident Diskette Handler
      - Normally utilized by the FMS
  2) Resident Diskette Handler
      - Component of the Atari OS
      - Utilizes SIO for communications with disk drives
      - Supports just five functions (four on the 400/800):
         1. GET SECTOR 
             - Read a specified sector
         2. PUT SECTOR WITH VERIFY 
             - Write sector; check sector to see if written
         3. STATUS REQUEST 
             - Ask the disk controller for its status
         4. FORMAT 
             - Issue a format command to the disk controller
         5. PUT SECTOR WITHOUT VERIFY
             - Write sector (don't check sector to see if written)
             - Available on XL/XE; not available on 400/800
      - 400/800: Uses 128 byte sectors
        XL/XE: Can read/write disk sectors having variable length from 1 to
               65536 bytes.  Default=128 bytes
      - Normally only used to load the FMS from disk.  Exception: Atari DOS I
        uses the OS-resident Diskette Handler for all disk communications.
  3) FMS (File Management Subsystem)
      - Must be loaded from disk (using the Resident Diskette Handler)
      - Normally utilizes SIO for disk drive communications
      - Does not utilize the Resident Diskette Handler.  Exception: Atari 
        DOS I uses the OS-resident Diskette Handler for all disk
        communications.
      - Normally provides a D: Disk File Manager device handler that is
        compatible with CIO
  4) CIO (Central Input/Output Utility) routine
      - Component of the Atari OS
      - Generalized high level, device independent access to device handlers,
        including any disk drive device handler provided by a FMS
  5) DUP (Disk Utility Package) or equivalent software program(s)
      - Optionally provided with a FMS
      - Must be loaded from disk using the FMS
      - Typically a DOS menu program, but could take any form of software
        that provides a user interface to FMS management functions
      - Normally utilizes CIO for carrying out disk management operations

In practice, those DOS components loaded into memory from disk, that is, a FMS
and any additional programs distributed with that FMS (such as a DUP), are
normally collectively described as a "DOS" on the Atari.

DOS XE
------
DOS XE DISK OPERATING SYSTEM  COPYRIGHT 1988 ATARI CORP.  VERSION 01.00
 - Shipped with XF551 disk drives starting in 1989
 - Developed by Bill Wilkinson for Atari.  Known as "ADOS" prior to release
 - Requires an XL/XE; does not run on the 400/800
 - Disk Utility Package (DOS menu) is loaded into memory with the FMS
 - Disk drive types supported: 
    1) Atari 810 (&amp; compatible)
    2) Atari 1050 (&amp; compatible)
    3) Atari XF551 -- XF551 high-speed supported
    4) Atari 130XE RAMdisk (64KiB)
    5) SSDD 5.25" Single-Sided, Double Density
 - Disk utilization/filesystems:
    1) "DOS XE" via the native D: Disk File Manager:
        - Supports disk drive sizes up to 16MiB.
        - Files can be up to 8MiB long.
        - All disks are addressed in 256 byte sectors.  Simulates 256 byte
          sectors on 810 and 1050 disk drives, which have 128 byte sectors,
          by reading and writing sector pairs.
        - Up to 65536 sectors can exist on a single disk.
          (65536 sectors x 256 bytes/sector = 16MiB)
        - Five different types of sectors:
           1) Boot sector
               - 3 sectors, always disk sectors 1-3
               - Contains a 32 byte Drive Table describing the physical and
                 logical layout of the disk.  
               - The RAMdisk does not have boot sectors.
           2) Volume Table of Contents (VTOC) sector
               - Starts in sector 4 (one sector only for drive types supported
                 by DOS XE).
               - The first 10 bytes give information about the current status
                 of the disk and the rest is a bit map of the blocks on the 
                 disk.
           3) Directory sector
               - The first directory block immediately follows the VTOC
                 sector(s).  Additional directory blocks are allocated as
                 needed and may be scattered throughout the disk, linked by a
                 two-byte pointer at the end of each block.
               - Each entry contains the file name, information about the
                 file (including creation date and last modified date), and up
                 to 12 two-byte pointers which point to the file map blocks
                 for the file.
               - Includes a six byte sector label, containing the File ID
                 number, Volume number, and Sequence number.
           4) File Map sector
               - Contain from 1 to 125 two byte data block pointers.
               - Includes a six byte sector label, containing the File ID
                 number, Volume number, and Sequence number.
           5) Data sector
               - 250 bytes allocated for data.
               - Includes a six byte sector label, containing the File ID
                 number, Volume number, and Sequence number.
    2) DOS 2.0 Single Density via the optional DOS 2.x A: Disk File Manager
    3) DOS 2.5 Enhanced Density via the optional DOS 2.x A: Disk File Manager

DOS XLE
-------
DOS II Version XLE ("DOS XLE") (P) 1990 Atari (Germany)
  Andreas Koch writes (January 2010):
   "programmed by Reitershan in 1990 (as requested by Atari Deutschland then
   for the XF551 drive), it is not only similar, but fully compatible to
   Turbo-DOS XL/XE (also by Reitershan).  It uses the well-familiar DOS 2.5
   DUP-menu, with a few enhancements, like e.g. 1-8 for Dir. of drive 1-8,
   formats 90KiB-360KiB and RAMdisks up to 256KiB; there is even an option (P)
   to switch back to standard DOS 2.5; this DOS has been written with the
   source-code of DOS 2.5 (made available for Reitershan by Atari
   Deutschland), so it is as compatible as possible to DOS 2.5 but still
   offers some enhancements; luckily all Turbo-DOS XL/XE utilities can be used
   with this DOS (e.g. the RAMdisk-driver from Turbo-DOS!);

------------------------------

Subject: 7.3.2) What are RealDOS, SpartaDOS X, and XDOS?

The continuing development of various modern mass storage options for the
8-bit Atari computers has necessitated ongoing development of supporting
disk operating systems.  This section describes full-featured disk operating
systems (DOS) for the Atari that remain actively developed today.

RealDOS
=======
RealDOS v1.0a Build 0031 (November 2012)
- Shareware from Integrated Logic Systems (ILS, Stephen J. Carden)
- Disk utilization/filesystem: SpartaDOS (SDFS)
- XL/XE with 64KiB RAM required.  Also designed to run on APE software and 
  hardware, or with an emulator.
- RealDOS contains both the MUX- and non-MUX SIOV.
  This DOS will realize how it is being called and will load the proper SIOV  
  handler for your needs.  RealDOS will configure itself by detecting your  
  hardware configuration.
- Fully supports: Black Box (all versions), ICD MIO, Ken Jones MIO, KPI 
  interface, Supra Interface, IDEa, SIO2PC, APE Registered Version, SIO2SD,
  SIO2IDE, SIO2USB, S-Drive and The Multiplexer. 
- RealDOS was also designed to work with the Atari800Win emulator.
- RealDOS does not support at this time the cartridge version of the MyIDE
  product.
Old version/Release history:
  RealDOS (or Real.DOS) shares its development heritage with disk-based
  SpartaDOS version 3.2c from ICD (which is described elsewhere in this FAQ
  list).  The features and capabilities of RealDOS may thus be further
  described in terms of changes and improvements made since ICD SpartaDOS
  3.2c...
   (NOTE: Prior to Real.Dos Build 0026, distribution of RealDOS was private.
    Exception: the Video 61 SpartaDOS 3.3C cartridge described below.)
-- SpartaDOS Ver 3.2p "30-Jan-86  Copyright (C) 1986 by ICD, Inc."
     o Support for the CSS Multiplexer ("MUX") in the form of a MUX-specific
       SIOV
     o Being based on SpartaDOS 3.2c, does not have the open file/directory
       bug/error found in later official SpartaDOS versions (3.2d, 3.2f, 3.2g,
       3.2gx), a problem known to be capable of trashing a hard drive
     o What was privately distributed as SpartaDOS 3.2p was initially
       developed from SpartaDOS 3.2c source code that was privately shared by
       ICD.  During the development process all new/modified sources were
       lost, so new sources were then reverse-engineered (by Ken Ames for
       Steve Carden) from surviving working executables and from memory,
       leading finally to SpartaDOS 3.2p.
     o Date of distribution unknown -- unreflected in the Version info
-- SpartaDOS Pro Ver 3.3a  3-Nov-94  "Copyright (C) 1994 by FTe"
     o Support for a Drive 9
     o MS-DOS work-alike command set

       compatible) instead of the MUX SIOV as in 3.3a.
-- SpartaDOS Pro Ver 3.3c 19-Dec-97  "(S)hareware  1997 by IFYB, Inc."
     o Same as 3.3a or 3.3b, but includes both SIOV versions, auto-selected
       based on hardware detected
-- Sparta DOS 3.3C  "(c) 1998 Video 61"
     o Same as Ver 3.3c 19-Dec-97 but modified by Video 61 to operate from a
       16KiB ROM cartridge.  Available: <a href=http://www.atarisales.com/>http://www.atarisales.com/</a>
     o According to Lance Ringquist of Video 61:
       K-Products (Bob Klaas) contracted with FTe (Mike Hohman) to develop
       SpartaDOS Pro 3.3 for exclusive use and distribution with K-Products'
       BBS Express! Pro.  When Video 61 purchased all rights associated with
       BBS Express! Pro from K-Products, the rights to SpartaDOS Pro 3.3
       were included.
     o According to Stephen Carden:
       The SpartaDOS Pro 3.3 versions were developed privately as hacks to
       ICD SpartaDOS 3.2c, the rights to which remain with FTe to this day.
-- SpartaDOS Ver 3.3d  1-Jan-98  "(S)hareware  1998 by IFYB, Inc."

Subject: 7.3.3) What are MyPicoDOS and Micro-SpartaDOS?

A "miniature DOS" / "gameDOS" / "microDOS" is a DOS version that is designed
to provide minimal capabilities.  Typically, this type of DOS makes the disk
bootable, and supports the launching of files on the disk.  This section 
describes current miniature DOS versions for the Atari.

MyPicoDos
=========
MyPicoDos 4.05 (C) 1992-2010 by Matthias Reichl
A "game-DOS" for DOS 2.x/MyDOS compatible disks with the following features:
    - It supports loading of COM/EXE, BIN (boot image) and BAS files.
    - It works with single and double density (hard-) disks from
      720 up to 65535 sectors.
    - Drives D1: to D8: can be accessed.
    - It supports MyDOS style subdirectories.
    - It supports Bibo-Dos style long directories (128 files per disk).
    - It supports XF551 format detection.
    - Builtin highspeed SIO code: compatible with ultra speed (Happy, Speedy,
      AtariSIO/SIO2PC/APE/...), Happy 810 Warp Speed, XF551 and Turbo 1050,
      up to 126 kbit/sec (POKEY divisor 0)
    - It supports displaying long filenames and a disk/directory title.
    - On XL/XE-type computers MyPicoDos can automatically switch BASIC on
      when loading a BASIC program, and switch BASIC off when
      loading a COM/EXE/BIN file.
    - Joystick support: either use arrow keys or a joystick to select
      the file.
    - Optional builtin atariserver (AtariSIO) remote console.
    - Separate "barebone" version without highspeed SIO support and
      remote console support (for those who want to save space)
    - Separate boot-sector-only version "PicoBoot" supporting a single
      COM file on a disk
    - Separate "SDrive" version which configures the SDrive to use
      110 or 126 kbit/sec transfer speed.

Micro-SpartaDOS
===============
Micro-SpartaDOS 4.6 (MSDOS.COM), 2010-09-07
Micro-SpartaDOS 4.5 (MSDOS.COM), 2010-06-12
 - Versions through 2.2: by Jiri Bernasek (BEWESOFT)
   Versions 2.3+ by Tomasz Pecko ('pecus') and Pawel Kalinowski ('pirx')
 - Disk allocation/filesystem:
    - SpartaDOS
    - Maximum number of directories entries is only limited by available RAM
Old versions/Changelog:
  MSDOS22.COM - original BEWESOFT version
    - by Jiri Bernasek - BEWESOFT (Prague, 93-05-03)
    - Version 2.2 supports also a high speed SIO for Speedy 1050, XF551 and
      the HDI.
Pecus &amp; Pirx modifications:
  MSINI2.COM  - Pecus &amp; Pirx variation on the menu editor.
  MSDOS23.COM - Pecus modified version with milti disc operation.
              - Keys 1-8 - select working drive and read the main directory.
  MSDOS30.COM - This version supports XF551 drives with HS, Happy Warp/
                US-Doubler drives with High Speed, and Speedy HS (only in
                US-Doubler mode).
              - Version 3.x+ are compatible with the SIO2IDE interface - 
  MSDOS43.COM - Warsaw, 2010-05-26
              - Version 4.3 of MSDOS is a serious rewrite, done primarily by
                Pecus.  It uses a novel approach to mapping index sectors. 
              - Version 4.3 supports quadruple sectors (512 bytes long);
                expands the available partition size to 32MiB.
              - Version 4.3 contains only the most popular Happy / UltraSpeed
                routines. 
              - Holding [SHIFT] during booting turns off HS I/O entirely.
              - This version detects BASIC and QMEG.  With QMEG the High Speed
                I/O is turned off as QMEG handles HS I/O by itself.
  MSDOS45.COM - Warsaw, 2010-06-12
              - Several bug fixes
              - Screen colors and TURBO mode configurable per directory.

   Microsystems, Inc. (SMI), developer of Atari DOS I and the File Manager
   System of Atari DOS II.
 - Introduced April 3-5, 1981 at the West Coast Computer Faire as: "CP/A" 
 - Original version of the Console Processor and the original version
   ("version 2") of the File Management Subsystem (FMS; identical with that of
   Atari DOS 2.0S) were written by Paul Laughton.  Other portions primarily by
   Mark Rose, with collaboration of Bill Wilkinson and Mike Peters.
 - Command line driven, with optional menu available
 - Version 1
    - Disk drive type supported: Atari 810 (&amp; compatible)
    - Disk allocation/filesystem: Atari DOS 2.0 Single Density
 - Version 2
    - Disk drive types supported: 
       1) Atari 810 (&amp; compatible)
       2) SSDD 5.25" Single-Sided, Double Density
    - Disk allocation/filesystems:
       1) Atari DOS 2.0 Single Density
       2) "Atari DOS 2.0 Double Density"
           - Format developed with Atari &amp; Percom for Atari 815 and Percom 
             single-sided, double density disk drives
           - 256 total bytes/sector, with 3 bytes of each sector used to
             address the next sector.  Exception: sectors 1-3 are single
             density, 128 bytes/sector.
           - 40 tracks * 18 sectors/track = 720 total sectors, with 13
             sectors used for software control or unused by the Disk File
             Manager.
           - Data capacity per diskette:
             707 sectors  x  253 bytes/sector  =  178,871 bytes/disk
           - 13 special sectors:
               1-3 FMS Boot record (single density sectors, 128 bytes/sector)
               360 Volume Table of Contents

      during the boot process.  From then on, may use the CONFIG command to
      manually change a disk drive's density.
    - STARTUP.EXC batch file of DOS XL commands (ATASCII text) runs at system
      boot (after AUTORUN.SYS)
    - RS232.COM provided for loading the R: handler from the 850 interface ROM

      switched with an OSS SuperCartridge, via DOSXL.SYS
    - Version 2.30C is Version 2.30 with DOSXL.SUP enabled as DOSXL.SYS, which
      saves 5KiB of user RAM by occupying memory which is bank-switched with an
      OSS SuperCartridge 
    - Version 2.30X is Version 2.30 with DOSXL.XL enabled as DOSXL.SYS, which
      saves 3KiB of user RAM by occupying memory available under the Atari OS
      (requires an XL/XE computer with at least 64KiB RAM).
    - BitWedge (BIT3.COM) Version 1.1 - 20DEC83
      Copyright (c) 1983 by Harald E. Striepe

         installed on an Atari 800.  From 371 sectors (64KiB plus 32KiB of
         standard RAM) to 896 sectors (two 64KiB boards plus a 32KiB board).
    - v2.30C Mosaic RamDisk.  Version by Harald E. Striepe and OSS.
       - v2.30 Mosaic RamDisk with DOSXL.SUP enabled as DOSXL.SYS, which
         saves 5KiB of user RAM by occupying memory which is bank-switched
         with an OSS SuperCartridge
    - OSS/Indus DOS XL 2.35 is OSS DOS XL 2.30 plus GTSYNC.COM, the 
      Indus GT Synchromesh Engager.  Copyright (C)(P) 1984, Indus Systems.
      Two versions of DOS XL 2.35 were released by Indus:
         - OSS DOS XL -  ATARI version 2.35I1  Copyright (C) 1983   OSS,Inc.
            - GTSYNC.COM VID: 01.02\01.01\01.01\01.21\01.21.
            - Supports Synchromesh 38.4 kbit/s on:
                Indus GT, LDW Super 2000, CA-2001
         - OSS DOS XL -  ATARI version 2.35I2  Copyright (C) 1983   OSS,Inc.
            - GTSYNC.COM VID: 01.10\01.01\01.10\01.30\01.30.
            - Supports Synchromesh 68.2 kbit/s on:
                Indus GT, LDW Super 2000, XFD601, XFD602
         - DOS XL 2.35I1 and DOS 2.35I2 were often (always?) distributed with
           RAM130.COM, written by Joseph Segura in 1985: a 64KiB RAMdisk for
           the 130XE.  Synchromesh (GTSYNC.COM) must be disabled in order to
           use RAM130 -- effectively, RAM130 is for DOS XL 2.30.
    - "DOS XL 2.35L" is described in the manuals for the LDW Super 2000 and
      CA-2001 disk drives.  However, original disks shipped with these drives
      are reported to be identical to DOS XL 2.35I1 (including RAM130.COM).
    - Version 2.30p is a patched Version 2.30 that fixes two bugs:
       1) A boot disk created from the DOS XL menu couldn't boot unless the 
          MENU.COM file was the disk.
       2) A boot disk initialized in a drive other than 1 would always boot
          up with that drive number as the working drive at the initial
          command line prompt.
       - OSS published a patch to convert version 2.30 to version 2.30p in 
         their Spring 1984 Newsletter.  OSS then published a corrected version
         of the 2.30p patch in their Fall 1986 Newsletter.  See:
         <a href=http://preview.tinyurl.com/o6cn9mm>http://preview.tinyurl.com/o6cn9mm</a>
    - Shipped with: Amdek AMDC-II, Astra 1620 (earlier units), CA-2001,
      Indus GT, LDW Super 2000, Percom RFD40-S1, Percom RFD40-S2, 
      Percom AT88-S1, Percom AT88-S2, Percom AT88-S1PD, Percom AT88-SPD  
 - Rights purchased from OSS by ICD in January 1988
   (but ICD discontinued DOS XL in favor of their own SpartaDOS)
 - Rights purchased from ICD by Fine Tooned Engineering (FTe) in 1993
 - FTe DOS XL 2.30 (including 2.30C and 2.30X) released on 6/22/94.
   They are identical to the OSS releases of the same versions.

 - Versions 4.x include support for high capacity drives (hard drives), up
   to 16MiB per partition.
 - Versions 4.x have full read compatibility with the Atari DOS 2.5 format,
   but will only write to the first 720 sectors of the disk.  (MYDOS has its
   own format for enhanced density disks that allows full access.)
 - Version 4.50 includes:

   <a href=http://www.wordmark.org/mydos.html>http://www.wordmark.org/mydos.html</a>
 - MyDOS 4.53 was released by David R. Eichel on 1/1/90, making minor changes
   from the released 4.50 and 4.51 source code.
    - Supports multiple AUTORUNs at boot up (*.AR0 through *.AR9).
      (Support for the traditional AUTORUN.SYS is removed.)
    - Fixes broken Axlon RAMdisk support
    - Version 4.53/3 gives 3 character file length/free sector count instead
      of the normal (for MyDOS) 4.
    - Version 4.53/4 is the same as 4.53/3, but uses a minimum of four
      characters in the sector count just like most versions of MyDOS.
 - More recent work on MyDOS by Lee Barnes is available, along with many
   earlier MYDOS versions, from Mathy van Nisselroy's MyDOS page:

 - SpartaDOS was developed by Mike Gustafson for ICD.
 - Disk allocation/filesystem: SpartaDOS (SDFS), supporting:
    o Subdirectories, up to 128 files per directory
    o Time/date stamping
    o Disks have volume names
    o Up to 16MiB per drive
 - Includes AT_RS232 R: handler for ATR8000 support
 - Version 1.1:
    o Requires 32KiB RAM 400/800/XL/XE
    o Not Atari DOS 2 compatible
 - Several flavors of Version 1.1:
    o SPEED.DOS - RAM resident full powered DOS; UltraSpeed supported
    o STANDARD.DOS - RAM resident full DOS; no UltraSpeed support
    o NOCP.DOS - No command processor; tries to load an AUTORUN.SYS file
                 before it passes control onto the cartridge; UltraSpeed
                 supported
    o NOWRITE.DOS - Can only read from disk, very low memory usage,
                    UltraSpeed supported; useful as a game loader
 - Changes for Version 2.3:
    o Requires a 64KiB XL/XE
    o An enhanced Atari DOS 2 handler: Can read, write, and run Atari DOS 2
      formatted diskettes in both single and double density
    o Supports 8 disk drives (as opposed to 4)
    o UltraSpeed High Speed built in 
    o 14 new internal command processor commands
    o 8 new XIO functions
    o Extra 4KiB program area
 - Two flavors of 2.3 (2.3b, 2.3e) versions:
    o XD type (XD23B.DOS or XD23E.DOS) is the full powered DOS; recognizes
      the STARTUP.BAT file when booted and priority is given to DOS (rather
      than the cartridge).
    o XC version (XC23B.DOS or XC23E.DOS) is the same as XD versions except
      AUTORUN.SYS is recognized when booted and control priority is given to
      the cartridge.
 - Changes for Version 3.2:
    o Better time and date support (internal TD, TIME, DATE commands)
    o Internal R-Time 8 interface
    o Internal JIFFY clock interface (for non-R-Time 8 users)
    o Internal 32 character keyboard buffer (and KEY command)
    o Automatic mini-buffer system for fast byte PUT and GET functions
    o New vectors added for machine language support
    o Control returned to DOS if DOS was active during RESET
    o Supports both a STARTUP.BAT and an AUTORUN.SYS file
    o Compatible with BASIC XE, 1200XLs and many modified Operating Systems
    o BASIC ON/OFF command operation from within a batch file (not end only)
    o NOISY I/O flag recognized
    o Support for the Supra Hard Disk Interface
    o All command entry in upper or lower case
    o Full read capability for Atari DOS 2.5 type enhanced density format
 - Several notable patches to SpartaDOS 3.2d have been developed, such as:
    o Bob Woolley created a patch utility program that will modify SpartaDOS
      3.2d to support the XF551's high speed I/O
    o "SpartaDOS 3.2z" was the result of a patch developed and distributed by
      Computer Software Services (CSS, Bob Puff) for SpartaDOS 3.2d to allow
      SpartaDOS to support the CSS Multiplexer (MUX).
      See: <a href=http://nleaudio.com/css/products/Mux_docs.htm>http://nleaudio.com/css/products/Mux_docs.htm</a>
 - Rights purchased from ICD by Fine Tooned Engineering (FTe, Mike Hohman) in
   1993 (November?).
 - FTe SpartaDOS 3.2g changes included:
     o Support for a ninth drive, D9:
     o D: means current working drive, instead of D1:
     o Full support for upper/lower case
     o CWD, CREDIR, DELDIR commands changed to CD, MD, RD
     o TDLINE Y2K bug fixed
     o 1200XL function keys work properly     
   SpartaDOS 3.2gx differs only in that it locates the disk buffers under the
   OS to save RAM.  3.2gx is intended for use in systems that include a PBI
   device (MIO, Black Box); it is not compatible with BASIC XE nor any other
   programs using RAM under the OS.
 - Many disk-based SpartaDOS versions are available for download from
   Thunderdome, kept by SysOp Fox-1:  <a href=http://mixinc.net/atari/a8men.htm>http://mixinc.net/atari/a8men.htm</a>

BW-DOS Ver. 1.10 (C) BEWESOFT / ABBUC 1994 (94-07-14)
  - Update #1 Released: 4/95
BW-DOS Ver. 1.30 (C) BEWESOFT 1995 (Jiri Bernasek)(95-12-17)
  - Update #2 Released (with Ver. 1.30): 95-12-17
------------------
Another popular, powerful DOS is BW-DOS (it is pronounced "Bay Vay Dos"),
freeware by Jiri Bernasek - BEWESOFT.
Andreas Koch writes:  "SpartaDOS compatible.  Does not use any speeder
internally, but comes with external XF551 speeder.  Supports 4 drives and
RAMdisk, comes with RAMdisk driver for XE compatible RAMdisks up to 1MiB;
supports 4 densities: a) Single (90KiB), b) Enhanced/Medium (130KiB), c)
Double (180KiB) and d) DSDD (360KiB); does not use any RAM under OS ROM (so it
works on an Atari 800 and with Turbo-BASIC XL); unlike SpartaDOS most commands
are external, thus the DOS is only 5KiB short; supports a PAL clock (made by
ABBUC regional group "ARGS"); comes with many great utilities (which can also
be used with SpartaDOS)."
 - Ver. 1.10 distributed by ABBUC as the "Jahresgabe" 1994
 - BW-DOS Update #1 Released: 4/95
    - New versions of: MENU, RAMDISK, DIRMAST.
    - New commands: MOVE, RTIME8, ARGSRTC
    - New driver: ARGSPRN
    - New program: BWDFUNCT.BAS
 - New in BW-DOS 1.30:
    - Reading the last byte of a file is now indicated by status 3.
    - Installation of new "E:" drivers is now allowed. 
    - The command "TYPE" is no more limited to 64 characters per line.
    - The method of handling the allocation pointers (positions 18 and 20 in
      sector 1) was changed.  The new method provides much better protection
      of the directory-area on disk, and so the directories are not mixed
      between data sectors as often as under older BW-DOS versions or
      SpartaDOS.  This results in faster access to directories.  100% read/
      write compatibility with every SpartaDOS versions 2.x and later
      retained.
 - BW-DOS Update #2 Release: 12/95 with BW-DOS 2.30
    - New versions of: BACKUP, COPY, UNERASE
    - New commands: DOSDRIVE, NEWED
    - New driver: RAMBOX

Subject: 7.3.5) What should I know about filenames and filename extensions?

Atari disk operating systems generally support file specifications in the form
of a filename of 1 to 8 characters, with an optional filename extension of
zero to 3 characters.

Valid characters for use in filenames/filename extensions:
(varies somewhat by DOS version)
 - The letters 'A' to 'Z'
 - The digits '0' to '9'
   (Many DOS versions do not permit filenames to start with a digit.)
 - The underscore character ('_') (DOS XE,SpartaDOS,RealDOS)
 - The "at" symbol ('@') (DOS XE)
Spaces and other characters are generally not permitted. 

Filenames and filename extensions are generally arbitrary, but file naming
conventions can be helpful.  The most common method is to reserve specific
extensions for certain types of files.  The following list contains some of
the more commonly used extensions and their typical corresponding file types. 
Filenames reserved by Atari DOS, SpartaDOS, RealDOS, or XDOS are listed as
well.

File formats are binary unless described below as "text" where:
 - Binary format files are made up of a sequence of bytes of any value from
   0-255.
 - Text format files (technically, a special-case of binary files) are 
   limited to printable/displayable alpha-numeric characters and symbols, 
   organized into lines.

  files);

DCS, the desktop construction set from Tom Hunt; there are 3 different
versions available, a) for DOS 2.5, b) for MyDOS and c) for Sparta-DOS; I have
tested the Sparta DOS version, which worked with batchfiles and could easily
load some ML files, text files and BASIC files (which were already on the DCS
disk); it also works with high densities and/or hard disk partitions up to
16MiB and supports subdirs of course; hmm, freeware or shareware ?!?

ATOS - GUI by Tom Hunt/Closer To Home.

Subject: 7.5) What should I know about R: and T: modem device handlers?

The Atari computer Operating System does not provide a modem device handler.
Modems can be connected to the Atari in several different physical ways: via
an 850 interface or equivalent, via a joystick/controller port, or via the SIO
port.  For each way a modem can be connected to the Atari, application 
software code specific to that type of modem must be utilized by the computer
to communicate with the modem.  

Some Atari programs, especially commercial telecommunications programs, simply
support one or several specific modem types, incorporating the necessary
modem-specific software routines internally.

Some programs, especially earlier public domain/freeware/shareware programs,
were released in several versions, each dedicated to a particular modem or
modem type.

Finally, as multiple modem types gained popularity, public domain/freeware/
shareware authors started abstracting the modem device handling software
routine from the rest of their telecommunication programs, allowing for a
single version of the main program to work with one or more separately-
distributed modem handler routines.  Users were then expected to combine an
application with an appropriate modem handler in order to create a complete,
working telecommunications software package.

This section attempts to list all Atari modem device handler files that can be
used in combination with telecommunications programs requiring such a handler.

==&gt; R: modem device handler on 850 interface ROM

The 850 contains an R: handler, supporting devices R1: through R4:, in its
ROM.  This R: handler supports the full range of capabilities of the RS-232-C
serial interface ports provided by the 850, but is typically used with an RS-
232-C serial interface modem.

With no powered disk drive #1 present, the R: handler loads from the ROM of a
powered 850 into computer RAM on system startup.  An extended beep is emitted
through the computer's audio signal as the handler is loaded.

The R: handler can also be loaded from 850 ROM into computer RAM as part of a
system Disk Boot or afterward by running a brief software utility for that
purpose.  Such utilities include:
- AUTORUN.SYS, distributed with Atari DOS 2.0S (1980)
- RS232.COM, distributed with OS/A+ and DOS XL by OSS (1982-1984)
- RS232FIX.COM, distributed with DOS XL by OSS (1982-1984).
  Explicitly attempts to correct some of the known bugs in the 850 R: handler.
- HANDLERS.SYS, distributed with Atari DOS 3 (1983)
- RS232.ARx, distributed with SmartDOS by Rana Systems (1984)
   - Should be renamed RS232.AR1 to be autorun by SmartDOS
   - Supports both warm and cold re-boots of the system
- AUTORUN.SYS, as generated by the Atari DOS 2.5 SETUP.COM utility (1984)
- RS232.COM for SpartaDOS, distributed with ICD SpartaDOS and with the ICD
  P:R: Connection (1986)
- RS232.SYS for Atari DOS 2, distributed with the ICD P:R: Connection (1986)
- BOOT850.COM, distributed with AMODEM 7.4 and 7.5 by Trent Dudley (1987)
- RDRIVER.SYS, distributed with Atari DOS XE (1988)
- ATARI850.AUT, distributed with MYDOS 4.50
- X850.COM, distributed with ANSITERM by Robert Sinclair (1992)
- PR.COM, distributed with ANSITERM by Robert Sinclair (1992)
- RS232.COM, part of RealDOS
- RS232.COM, part of SpartaDOS X

Special to the P:R: Connection (popular 850 workalike):
- PRC.SYS is an R: handler "translator" distributed with the P:R: Connection
  by ICD (1986).  Allows some telecommunications programs (such as HomePak
  HomeTerm) with integrated support for 850-based modems, but that do not load
  or use the internal 850 R: handler, to work with the P:R: Connection.

==&gt; R: modem device handlers for MPP-1000/1000C/1000E and Supra 300AT modems
- MPPHAND.AUT, Version 1.0, by John S. DeMar, 1983(?)

==&gt; T: modem device handler on 1030 modem ROM

In addition to the ModemLink software program, the 1030 modem ROM also
contains the T: modem device handler that can be loaded and utilized by user
programs apart from ModemLink.

The T: device handler does not use the SIO protocol for data transmission with
the computer, creating potential conflict with other devices connected via
SIO that also don't use the SIO protocol, including the C: cassette handler
built into the Atari OS.  Consequently, there should be no program recorder
attached to the system when using a T: modem device handler.

The handler supports tone dialing, but is not self-relocating, and thus must
be loaded before Atari BASIC is initialized.  Extensive T: handler details
published by Russ Wetmore: <a href=http://www.atarimagazines.com/v4n4/1030modem.html>http://www.atarimagazines.com/v4n4/1030modem.html</a>

==&gt; R: modem device handlers for both 850-based and 835/1030/XM301 modems

- R.BIN, by Joe Miller and Russ Wetmore for Star Systems Software, 1984/5(?)
  "A combined handler for 850-based and 835/1030 modems...an extensive 
   modification of Joe Miller's original handler from his...TSCOPE.  While
   TSCOPE uses a "T:" handler (standard for 835/1030 modems), R.BIN is
   installed as an "R:" device."  Self-relocating.  Does not support tone
   dialing on the 1030.
- RHANDLR1.030 is identical to R.BIN but also executes RUN "D:MENU" after
  loading (perhaps for a disk of the month for an Atari user group).
- 'RHANDLER2' (RHANDLR2 or RHAND2.BIN or RHAND2.AUT) is a slightly modified
  version of R.BIN which also executes the BASIC command RUN"D:*.RUN" after

or a light gun in the same way.  Consequently, while software programs may be
intended for one or the other, these two types of controllers may often
substitute for each other.

A light pen or light gun requires a cathode ray tube (CRT) television or
monitor.  Only one light pen or light gun may be used on the Atari at a time.
Controller Jacks 1-3 on the 400 do not support a light pen / light gun.

Subject: 8.11) What programs support Atari computer networking?

This section started by Andreas Koch.

There are two different hardware add-ons which provide a "computer- 
network" (two or more Ataris linked together).  Thus, there is software 
that supports either one or the other hardware (namely GameLink or
GameLink-II).  The following software supports the networking hardware:

- GameLink (by DataQue, 1990): 
  - Computer Battleship, by John Babson and Bill Cleis, 
    as patched by Rick Detlefsen for GameLink
  - Tic-Tac-Two (a tic-tac-toe clone) by DataQue, 1990

- GameLink-II (by DataQue, 1993) / Multilink (by Bewesoft):
  - Maze of Agdagon (full version, 2-8 players) by The AGDA Group, 1993
  - Multi-Dash (2-8 players, XL/XE only) by Bewesoft;
  - Multi-Race (2-16 players, XL/XE only) by Bewesoft;
  - Multi-Worms (2-8 or 2-16? players, XL/XE only) by Bewesoft;
  - "Starter-kit" module to use in your own networking-games by Bewesoft
    (free use of this module is granted by Bewesoft/Jiri Bernasek);

Subject: 9.1) What file formats for entire disks/tapes/cartridges are there?

It is now common, especially when working on modern computers, to work with
Atari software as files or "images" containing the data from an entire disk,
data cassette, or cartridge as duplicated from the native media for the Atari.

Here is a list of file formats, arranged by their associated filename
extensions.  These are all filename extensions used to name files containing
entire 8-bit Atari floppy disk images, cassette tape images, or cartridge
images.

.ATP -Atari Protected Disk Image Format.  An open disk format suitable for
      storing copy protected disks (similar to the APE .PRO format).
      Version 1.6, 2004-4-11, by the ATP Working Group:
      <a href=http://www.ataripreservation.org/websites/freddy.offenga/ATP16.htm>http://www.ataripreservation.org/websites/freddy.offenga/ATP16.htm</a>

.ATR -Image format invented by Nick Kennedy, for his SIO2PC project.
      Very similar to .XFD but with an added 16 byte header.
      This is the most common image format, used with most 8-bit Atari
      emulators running on other computer platforms.
      SIO2PC is at <a href=http://pages.suddenlink.net/wa5bdu/sio2pc.htm>http://pages.suddenlink.net/wa5bdu/sio2pc.htm</a>

.ATX -Image format invented by Jorge Cwik, for VAPI project.  Goal of Vapi is
      the preservation of Atari software in its original unmodified form,
      including custom format or copy protection.  <a href=http://vapi.fxatari.com/>http://vapi.fxatari.com/</a>
      Also: <a href=http://www.whizzosoftware.com/sio2arduino/vapi.html>http://www.whizzosoftware.com/sio2arduino/vapi.html</a>

.BIN -Same as .ROM, see below.

.CAR -Cartridge ROM image format invented for the Atari800 emulator.  Format
      includes information about cartridge type.  Contains the 'CART'
      signature at the beginning of the file.
      See: https://github.com/dmlloyd/atari800/blob/master/DOC/cart.txt

.CAS -Cassette image format invented by Ernest R. Schreurs, for his 
      Digital Cassette Image system (includes CAS2SIO, WAV2CAS, and CAS2WAV
      MS-DOS utilities.  See: <a href=http://home.planet.nl/~ernest/>http://home.planet.nl/~ernest/</a>
       - The .CAS format was extended by Tomasz Krasuski, for his
         A8CAS system.  See: <a href=http://a8cas.sourceforge.net/>http://a8cas.sourceforge.net/</a>
       - More .CAS tools: 
         <a href=http://sdq.czweb.org/old_computers/atari/projects/tapeproj.html>http://sdq.czweb.org/old_computers/atari/projects/tapeproj.html</a>
      
.DCM -Image format invented by Bob Puff for his Disk Communicator 3.2 utility.
      Intended for use on native Atari hardware.  A compressed data format.
      DISKCOMM is at <a href=http://www.nleaudio.com/css/files/DISKCOM.ARC>http://www.nleaudio.com/css/files/DISKCOM.ARC</a>
      .DCM specs at: <a href=http://home.planet.nl/~ernest/diskcomm.zip>http://home.planet.nl/~ernest/diskcomm.zip</a>

.DD  -Early filename extension used with double density disk images for use
      with the Xformer emulators.  Replaced by the .XFD extension.

.DI  -Image format invented by Kolja Koischwitz &amp; Christian Krueger for
      800XL DJ, their 1050/XF551 disk drive emulator for the Atari
      ST/TT/Falcon.
      800XL Deejay: <a href=http://www.umich.edu/~archive/atari/Emulators/800xldj.lzh>http://www.umich.edu/~archive/atari/Emulators/800xldj.lzh</a>

.IPF -Interchangeable Preservation Format invented by the Software 
      Preservation Society (SPS), <a href=http://www.softpres.org/>http://www.softpres.org/</a>.  A platform 
      agnostic format that is extremely low-level, representing the
      information as it would have been read by a drive head.  Images are 
      created on a modern computer using the KryoFlux USB-based floppy 
      controller: <a href=http://www.kryoflux.com/>http://www.kryoflux.com/</a>

.PRO -Proprietary image format invented by Steven Tucker, for his
      APE ProSystem.  <a href=http://www.atarimax.com/>http://www.atarimax.com/</a>

.ROM  ROM dump file, raw with no header information.  Typically a cartridge
      memory dump, but also used for an operating system memory dump.

.SCP -Image format invented by ICD, for SpartaDOS.  Used with the external
      SpartaDOS command SCOPY, distributed with SpartaDOS 3.2.  Used when
      working with native Atari hardware.  A compressed data format.

.SD  -Early filename extension used with single density disk images for use
      with the Xformer emulators.  Replaced by the .XFD extension.

.XFD -"Xformer Floppy Disk" image format invented by Emulators, Inc. (Darek
      Mihocka) for the Xformer emulators (ST, PC).  Known earlier, before
      support for arbitrary disk sizes was added, as .SD or .DD depending on
      the density of the imaged disk.  The format consists simply of a raw
      sector dump of a disk.  Used with ST Xformer, PC Xformer, and 
      Xformer 2000 emulators.
      Xformer emulators are at <a href=http://www.emulators.com/>http://www.emulators.com/</a>

Subject: 10.2) What programs can I use to host a BBS on the Atari?

Contributors to this section include: Winston Smith, Steven Sturza, Chad
Hendrickson, Don Fanning, Matt Singer, Pete Davis, Jeff Williams, Rod Roark

"A BBS, plain and simple, is some hobbyist setting up their own computer to
answer incoming calls from other hobby computers.  The visiting person
leaves messages on this computer for other visitors, plays games while
visiting, sends and receives files, and all that." -- Greg Goodwin, 2005

The 8-bit Atari was popular for hosting a dial-up Bulletin Board System (BBS).
This section attempts to list all BBS programs for the Atari.

For most programs listed, a link is provided to the corresponding section at
<a href=http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/>http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/</a> which is a comprehensive collection
of BBS information, screenshots, and downloads collected by Jason Scott.

  o  AMIS (Atari Message &amp; Information System)
AMIS by Tom Giese was the first BBS program for the 8-bit Atari, released
either fall 1981 or some time in 1982.  Written in BASIC.  It included designs
for a ring-detector.  You needed a sector editor and had to allocate message
space by hand, hex byte by hex byte.  The AMIS BASIC source code proved a 
popular starting point for a number of popular AMIS variations:
     *  AMIS ("Standard AMIS"), by Tom Giese, 1981 or 1982
        Public domain from CLAUG (Chicago)
        For Hayes Smartmodem connected via 850 interface

     *  Fast AMIS, by Stan Subeck &amp; Susie Subeck
        Public domain from Valley Girl BBS (Chicago)
        According to Antic v3n9Jan85:
        - Built-in modem commands for a Hayes Smartmodem.
        - Requires some modification to run with an MPP, Signalman Mark 7 or 
          Mark 12 modem.
        - Requires a different method of auto-answer than other BBS programs,
          and demands a different setting of the modem's internal DIP
          switches.
        - Message files compact automatically.

     *  Carnival BBS, by ???????
        - "essentially AMIS with an overlay to allow for private messages and
        passwords." --Antic v3n9Jan85
        - "demands a large amount of disk space and requires every bit of
          memory your system has." --Antic v3n9Jan85

        * Reed Audio BBS, by Todd Gordanier, 1986
          - A modified version of Carnival BBS that added multiple forum 
            support &amp; support for the Atari 1030 modem by way of a hardware 
            ring detector (relay). (wikipedia)
     *  Comet AMIS, by Matt Pritchard and Tom Johnson
        <a href=http://bbslist.textfiles.com/704/oldschool.html>http://bbslist.textfiles.com/704/oldschool.html</a>
        - Home was Comet AMIS of Algonic, MI
        - Originally MPP AMIS by Matt Pritchard, for MPP modems only 
          (John DeMar of New York State wrote the MPP drivers), then
          modified to be used with other types of standard modems.
        - Some heavy involvment of Trent Condellone in certain features 
        - The final version featured many automated tasks, usage logs, 
          passwords, private mail, multiple message bases and support for hard
          drives and MYDOS, and was on the cutting edge of AMIS/Atari 8-bit 
          BBS technology. (wikipedia)
     *  AMIS XM301, by Mike Olin and Mike Mitchell (Catspaw Software Systems)
        - Written in BASIC XE (wikipedia)
     *  TODAMIS 1.0, by Trent Dudley, 1986

<a href=http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/ATARI/EIGHTBIT/ARMUDIC/>http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/ATARI/EIGHTBIT/ARMUDIC/</a>
From the Downtown Washington Atari Users Group of Washington, D.C.
Greg Leslie writes "It was written (in BASIC with machine language
subroutines) by Frank Huband, and the name came from the numbers used to dial
the original BBS (276-8342).

  o  ATABBS - Atari Bulletin Board System
     Rod Roark writes (3/12/03):
                This is really straining my memory -- don't recall exactly
                when I wrote the thing (maybe '80 or '81), but as far as I
                know ATABBS was the world's first BBS for the Atari 400/800.
                
                I ran it out of my condo in Atlanta on a 48KiB 400 with a 
                90KiB floppy drive and a 300 bit/s Hayes Smartmodem.  The
                48KiB memory module was a third party add-on, not Atari's.
                
                It was written in Atari BASIC with a few bytes of machine
                language thrown in.
  
  o  AtariLink BBS -- program by Paul Sungenis and Darren M. Benfer,
                      Version 1.43 (c) 1987-1988 Paul L.A. Sungenis
From his blog at <a href=http://atari8programming.blogspot.com/>http://atari8programming.blogspot.com/</a> on 3/20/06:
In 1985-1986 I wrote and eventually released the AtariLink BBS software.  This
came out of necessity, since most Atari BBS programs at the time (especially
FoReM and its bastard children) didn't fully support the 1030 modem that I
used (or the XM301 that followed afterward).  I eventually adapted the program
to work with Atari's 1200 bit/s SX212 modem when that was released, and in the
process threw the program open to just about every modem out there.  AtariLink
floated in the wild, passed from BBS to BBS for a while, before an Atari
magazine (I forget which one) distributed the software as its disk of the
month.
 - Requires Atari BASIC; BASIC XE supported
 - Recommended SpartaDOS 2.3b/e or SpartaDOS X due to memory requirements.
 - Expandable with Door programs

  o  ATKeep --  An Atari 8-bit version of CITADEL BBS, by Brent Barrett
<a href=http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/ATARI/EIGHTBIT/ATKEEP/>http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/ATARI/EIGHTBIT/ATKEEP/</a>
ATKeep is a Citadel-like BBS system for eight-bit Ataris.  ATKeep runs under
SpartaDOS and requires BASIC XE and 128KiB of RAM.  Originally "MBBBS (Message
Base Bulletin Board System) 1.0, March 24th, 1986" MBBBS was changed to Atari
Keep, or, ATKeep for short, around version the time version 4.0 was released
(June 15, 1986).

ATKeep 7.0 finally took the aide and cosysop commands out of a menu section
and put them into extended commands, where they belonged.  It also added a
SYSOP level command set.  Users were no longer "users" "aides" or "cosysops,"
they had become level "A" (SYSOP) through level "Z" (READ ONLY).  The system
had become extremely complex.  Public, hidden OR password protected PRIVATE
rooms.  Each room now had its own access level (thus keeping people of lower
level from getting in EVEN if they knew the room name).  Each room was
assigned a RWRT (or Read WRiTe status), which determined who could enter
messages in it, and whether or not public or private messages, or both were to
be allowed.

Before version 7.0, ATKeep only worked with the Atari 1030 or XM301 modems.
ATKeep 7.0 was rewritten to accommodate the 850 or PRC interface allowing use
of any Hayes compatible modem.

ATKeep version 7.50 was released (1987), was version 8 released?

  o  BBCS -- Bulletin Board Construction Set, by Scott Brause/Antic, 1985
<a href=http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/ATARI/EIGHTBIT/ABBCS/>http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/ATARI/EIGHTBIT/ABBCS/</a>
A machine language program, developed as the Jersey Atari Computer Group
(JACG) BBS system.

BBCS was known for its great flexibility.  The sysop was offered easy
customization by the use of menus.  Many BBSes before it required that you had
to actually change the BASIC code in order to customize your BBS.

Unfortunately, it also suffered from a reputation for stability problems.

  o  BBS Express!  -- 1986-1989, Keith Ledbetter/Orion Micro Systems
<a href=http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/ATARI/EIGHTBIT/BBSEXPRESS/>http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/ATARI/EIGHTBIT/BBSEXPRESS/</a>

<a href=http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/ATARI/EIGHTBIT/BBSEXPRESSPRO/>http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/ATARI/EIGHTBIT/BBSEXPRESSPRO/</a>
Originally released in 1988 by Keith Ledbetter and Chris King from Orion Micro
Systems.  bf2k+ wrote (May 2010) that version 2.1a was the last version
compiled by Keith Ledbetter before he sold it.

Version 5.0 Copyright 1995 by K-Products (Bob Klaas) credited to:

<a href=http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/ATARI/EIGHTBIT/CARINA/>http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/ATARI/EIGHTBIT/CARINA/</a>
Originally developed by Jerry Horanoff; a complete re-write of Carina BBS.

Requires an XL or XE computer, at least 500KiB of storage capacity (including
RAMdisk and drives), and SpartaDOS version 2.3 or greater.
Recommended: 192KiB RAMdisk or greater, and an R-Time cartridge.
Fully supported: An MIO interface and a hard drive.

Pete Davis writes (15 Aug 2002):
Carina was a pretty powerful BBS system.  Though it was written in BASIC (with
a number of machine language routines), it was expandable and was able to load
new BASIC programs with the BBS running.  In fact, it was quite modular and
would load different sections of the BBS at runtime.  I actually used it when
I ran a BBS some time back.

Versions that operate with the Atari 850, the ATR 8000 CP/M interface, and
other configurations.  Written in Atari BASIC.

Matt Singer writes:
FoReM BBS derived from an early AMIS.  When multiple message areas were
added the name was extended to FoReM 26M.  Then, When OSS released BASIC
XL the program was rehacked and called FoReM XL... Bill Dorsey wrote most

  o  MBBBS (Message Base Bulletin Board System)

  o  NITE-LITE BBS --  Paul Swanson's BBS with RAMdisk.
<a href=http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/ATARI/EIGHTBIT/NITELITE/>http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/ATARI/EIGHTBIT/NITELITE/</a>
Paul Swanson was a programmer from the Boston, Massachusetts, USA, area.

"1983: Nite-Lite B.B.S. goes on the air. (Was it running A.M.I.S. ?) It is
called "Nite-Lite" because the computer monitor casts an eerie glow about the
room.  1984: Paul Swanson writes his own BBS hosting software for the Atari
8-bit computer.  He names it "Nite-Lite".  The Nite-Lite BBS hosting
software goes on to be the most successful commercial BBS software ever
written for the Atari 8-bit computer.  1989: Nite-Lite BBS puts in a
second line. (MichTron boards eventually take the place of all of the Atari
Nite-Lite boards.)" - Winston Smith

This BBS was the first to support a RAMdisk, which Paul Swanson called a "V:"
device for "virtual disk".  This BBS was written in Atari BASIC and required a
joystick hardware "dongle" device.  This was notable as being one of the first
Atari 8-BIT BBSs that could actually go for a week without having to be
rebooted.  Pointers to the message base were kept in an Atari "very long
string" (for which Atari BASIC is famous).  The BBS would only have problems
(for the most part) if this string became corrupted.

  o  OASIS (the commercial version) / OASIS Jr. (the public domain version)
<a href=http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/ATARI/EIGHTBIT/OASISIV/>http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/ATARI/EIGHTBIT/OASISIV/</a>
<a href=http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/ATARI/EIGHTBIT/OASISJR/>http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/ATARI/EIGHTBIT/OASISJR/</a>
The original OASIS BBS System was written by Rich Renner and Ralph Walden with
tech support and input from Leo Newman.  It was first published by OASIS BBS
Systems (Renner/Walden/Newman) in 1986, and distributed by Leo Newman.  Later,
the rights were transferred to Glenda Stocks/Z INNOVATORS, then later (1991)
to Jeff Williams ("Alf").

All machine language.  OASIS is very crash-resistant and comes with a "dial
out" screen so that the Sysop can use the BBS as a terminal program to call
and fetch files without having to bring the BBS down and reload a terminal
program.  OASIS supports "Door programs" which it refers to as "OASIS PAL
modules".  An excellent message system, and a complex file system.  It
consists of "file libraries" with suites of "file types".  There is quite a
bit of overhead involved in performing a download (which may be a good thing,
as it discourages file hogs).  OASIS IV performs networking.  SpartaDOS 3.2x
recommended, but any DOS supported.  R-Time 8 clock cartridge supported.

Glenda Stocks writes at <a href=http://world.std.com/~snet/glenda.htm>http://world.std.com/~snet/glenda.htm</a> :
I purchased the source code rights to OASIS and began marketing the BBS
software to Atari 8-bit enthusiasts around the world.  I felt that I had the
superior BBS software because I had programmed in the ability to run external
programs, including online games and user surveys.  I also had added color
prompts for IBM clone users who called Atari boards running my OASIS software.
Sometime in 1991...I sold the rights to OASIS to a man in Canada..

Jeff Williams ("Alf") writes: (12/6/02)
OASIS was around prior to either PRO or BBS Express! IIRC.  I don't know when
exactly it showed up, version 3.09 was the first one I remember seeing.  What
made it nifty was it was very fast, being all assembler, and having some
different features that things like Forem &amp; Carina didn't have.  Compared to
something like Forem MPP at the time, it was kind of amazing.

Ralph Walden sold it to Glenda Stocks, who chopped it up into modules and sold
it as ver 4.7.  PRO was out by then, and was a much more complete offering
imo.  Glenda wrote some modules for 4.7, but it never really went anywhere
because the architecture was so cramped with her changes.

Eventually she gave up and sold me the source.  I looked it over and realized
it was a mess and nothing was going to happen with it.  I worked on a version
5 for a while, but never made much progress.

This program is written entirely in BASIC.  It expects to be running under a
SpartaDOS environment.  This BBS program uses a "modem clock string" rather
than an R-Time 8 cartridge in order to retrieve the current time.  It also
comes with an Atari BASIC game door called "Sabotage".

Subject: 10.3) How can I read/write Atari diskettes with my other computer?

There are several programs that allow an MS-DOS system to work with an
Atari-format 5.25" diskette.  Most of these work with the Atari SS/DD 180KiB
format.

There is also a device, detailed below, that allows an external 5.25" floppy
disk drive to be connected to a modern PC via a USB port, and which supports
reading Atari DOS 2 SS/DD 90KiB floppy disks. 

Atari-Link PC (AtariDsk) V1.2 (c) 95-12-09
==========================================
  by HiassofT (Matthias Reichl)
  Ataridsk is a program for MSDOS-PCs that allows you to access Atari floppy
  disks in double density (180KiB).  All you need is a PC (XT or 286 should be
  sufficient) and a 5.25" floppy drive.  Features of this tool:
    * Menu driven user interface
    * Read, write and format Atari disks on the PC
    * Small size (only 35KiB)
  <a href=http://www.horus.com/~hias/atari/>http://www.horus.com/~hias/atari/</a>

WriteAtr V0.92b
===============
  by HiassofT (Matthias Reichl)
  With WriteAtr you can write double density ATR-images to Atari floppy disks
  on your MSDOS-PC.  You can also create ATR-images of double density floppy
  disks!  All you need is a PC and a 5.25" and/or a 3.5" floppy drive.
  Version 0.92b added experimental support for the enhanced density (1040
  sectors/128 bytes per sector) format.  Please note: this format doesn't work
  with a lot of floppy controllers - use it at your own risk!

===============================================================
Here's some advice on using the above utilities from Hans Breitenlohner:

There are two technical obstacles to interchanging disks between
DD Atari drives and PC drives.

1. The Atari drive spins slightly slower (288 RPM instead of 300 RPM).
   If you format a disk on the Atari, then write sectors on the PC, it is
   possible that the header of the next physical sector will be overwritten,
   making that sector unreadable.  (The next physical sector is usually
   the current logical sector+2).  The solution to this is to format all
   disks on the PC.
       (Aside:  Does anybody know how this problem is handled on the
        XF551?  Is it also slowed down?)
     Konrad Kokoszkiewicz answers:
     "The XF551 disk drive is not slowed down - these drives are spinning
     300 rotations per minute.  To prevent troubles with read/write disks
     formatted and written on normal Atari drives (288 rot/min), the main
     crystal frequency for the floppy disk controller is 8.333MHz
     (not 8MHz, as in 1050, for example)."

2. If the PC drive is a 1200KiB drive there is the additional problem of the
   track width.
   The following is generally true in the PC world:
    - disks written on 360KiB drives can be read on either drive
    - blank disk formatted and written on 1200KiB drives can be read on
      either kind
    - disks written on a 360KiB drive, and overwritten on a 1200KiB drive,
      can be read reliably only on a 1200KiB drive.
    - disks previously formatted on a 360KiB drive, or formatted as 1200KiB,
      and then reformatted on a 1200KiB drive to 360KiB, can be read reliably
      only on a 1200KiB drive.
   (All this assumes you are using DD media, not HD.)

   Solution: Use a 360KiB drive if you can.  If not, format disks on the
   Atari for Atari to PC transfers, format truly blank disks on the PC
   for PC to Atari transfers.

Jon D. Melbo sums it up this way:
   So a basic rule of thumb when sharing 360KiB floppies among 360KiB &amp;
   1200KiB drives is: Never do any writes with a 1200KiB drive to a disk that
   has been previously written to in a 360KiB drive....UNLESS... you only
   plan on ever using that disk in the 1200KiB drive from then on out.  Of
   course a disk can be reformatted in a particular drive any time for use
   in that drive.  As long as you follow that rule, you can utilize the
   backward compatible 360KiB modes that most 1200KiB drives offer.

AnaDisk + DeAna
===============
While the above mentioned utilities work with SS/DD 180KiB Atari-format disks
or SS/DD 180KiB SpartaDOS disks, the following combination of utilities has
been used successfully to read SS/SD 90KiB Atari-format disks.  So if you only
have standard Atari 810 and/or Atari 1050 drives, you could look into:

AnaDisk, created by Chuck Guzis at Sydex, Inc. in 1987
- "Scan, edit, repair and copy just about any kind of diskette"

utilities.

Preston Crow writes:
  "As best as I can figure it out, if your PC drive happens to read
  FM disks (I'm not sure what the criteria for that is), then you
  can read single density disks on your PC by dumping the contents
  to a file with AnaDisk, and then using Deana.com to convert the
  dump file into a usable format.

  For enhanced density disks, AnaDisk generally only reads the first
  portion of each sector, but it demonstrates that it is possible for
  a PC drive to read enhanced density disks."

Subject: 10.5) How do I transfer files using a null modem cable?

This section by Russ Gilbert.

Q:  How do I connect two computers using a null modem cable?

A:  You need a term program and RS-232 ports on both
    computers.  The RS-232 ports need to be connected
    together using a 'null modem cable'.

    For up to 4800 baud, no flow control lines need be
    connected.  Just cross the transmit and receive lines
    and join the grounds together.  Transmit is pin #2,
    receive is pin #3 and ground is pin #7 on the 25 pin
    port.  25 pin #2 goes to Atari #4 (XMT to RCV), 25 pin
    #3 goes to #3 on Atari (RCV to XMT) and #5 of 850 goes
    to #7 of 25 pin (GND to GND).

    The right hand pin on the 'long' side of a female 'D'
    connector is #1.  There are 13 holes on this 'long'
    side, 12 holes on the 'short' side.  The numbers go
    to the left 1 to 13 then #14 is under #1 and left again
    so that #25 is under #13.

    Most term programs allow a null connection, without a
    carrier detect.  Notably, '850 Express!' does not.  I have
    only used 'Procomm 2.4.3' (the last shareware version of
    Procomm) on the PC and BobTerm on the Atari, but other
    term programs may work.

    To check your null modem connection, start both PC and
    Atari term programs, set baud to 2400 or 4800 on both
    computers.  No parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit on the PC.
    Be sure to use the correct COM port on the PC.  Go to
    'terminal' mode and you should now be able to type on
    either computer and see it on the other screen.  To
    accomplish a file transfer, use Y-modem probably from
    BobTerm, rather than X-modem.  X-modem will often append
    bytes to a file transfer, an undesirable event.  There is
    also a very nice Z-modem receive program for the Atari,
    called ATAR-Z-MODEM by Larry Black for the Atari.

    A convenient way to make a null modem cable, up to about
    30 feet long, is to use two DB-25S connectors
    (Radio Shack) some three or more conductor cable.  Using
    the two DB-25S connectors allows unplugging your
    modems and plugging in the null modem cable into the two
    modem cables.  This also avoids the confusion of
    variations in the computer ports.  Most computers connect
    into the modem end via a standard RS-232 DB25 connection.
    With this both ends 25 pin cable, you would cross pins 2
    and 3 and connect the #7s together to make a null modem
    cable.

    The SIO port on the Atari cannot be used directly.  An
    850, P:R: Connection, MIO, Black Box or similar device
    that provides an RS-232 port must be used.


    Following are pin assignments for a DB25 pin RS-232-C
    port.
1.  Protective Ground        12.  Select Alternate Rate
2.  Transmit Data            15.  Transmit Clock (sync)
3.  Receive Data             17.  Receive clock (sync)
4.  RTS (Request to Send)    20.  Data Terminal Ready
5.  CTS (Clear to Send)      22.  Ring indicator
6.  Data Set Ready           23.  Select Alternate Rate
7.  Signal Ground            24.  Transmit Clock
8.  Carrier Detect

   For higher speed connections, above 4800 or 9600, you
   need the flow control lines and Atari term software that
   has flow control built in.  You also need an MIO or Black
   Box, which uses the PBI (parallel bus).  A high speed
   cable would need not only XMT, RCV, and GND, but also
   flow control lines.  I suggest a commercial null modem
   from computer store to ensure correct lines.  A null
   modem is a small adapter with the correct lines already
   crossed.  I don't know how to correctly connect the CTS,
   RTS, DTR, DSR, CRX lines for a high speed null modem.
   With a null modem, you just plug it into the 25 pin
   connectors of the two modem cables you might already
   have connected to your Atari and PC or Mac.  You may need
   a straight thru 25 pin gender changer also.

   Following is in this FAQ elsewhere, but I summarize here:
   (Figure out or look for pin numbers on the ports.) Note
   that these are pin assignments, and NOT null modem
   connections with the XMT, RCV crossed and GND straight
   thru.

   Atari 8-bit  PC AT 25   PC AT 9 pin
   -------------------------------------
    1. DTR          20          4*
    2. CRX           8          1*
    3. XMT           2          3
    4. RCV           3          2*
    5. GND           7          5
    6. DSR           6          6
    7. RTS           4          7
    8. CTS           5          8
    9. No connect?   shield     RI
                  22 RI

Note: * above indicates the difference between an AT 9 pin
and a Atari 8-bit 9 pin cable connector, e.g., if you check
continuity from pin 3 of 25 pin end and it goes to pin
4 of nine pin end, you have an Atari serial cable.  If pin
3 of 25 pin goes to pin 2 of 9 pin end, you have a PC
serial cable.

1977
February 17: Earliest recorded engineering discussions between Synertek/Atari
engineer Jay Miner and Atari engineer Joe Decuir regarding "New Machines."
Atari (Consumer) programmer Larry Kaplan would contribute to the early concept
as well.  (Atari Inc.: Business is Fun, p. 446)

Atari, Inc. was a Warner Communications Inc. (WCI) company.

Spring/Summer: The Miner/Decuir "New Machines" concept at Atari evolved into
"Stella A/N" ("Stella Alpha Numeric"; "Stella" had been the Atari VCS project
name) and then into: "Home Computer" (Atari Inc.: Business is Fun, p. 447)

June/July: John Vurich, previously National Semiconductor product marketing
manager, joined Atari (Consumer) as Manager of Product Planning.

August 9: The "Home Computer" Atari VCS successor concept was designated the
"Colleen" project at Atari.  (Atari Inc.: Business is Fun, p. 449)

August 12-16: At Atari's Cyan Engineering, Atari engineer Joe Decuir, Cyan
senior engineer Steve Mayer and Cyan engineer Ron Milner (reuniting the three
original designers of the Atari VCS) worked on the overall "Colleen" system
design.  (<a href=http://www.atarimuseum.com/articles/joedecuir.html>http://www.atarimuseum.com/articles/joedecuir.html</a> and Atari Inc.:
Business is Fun, p. 451)

August 22: Atari "Colleen" major specifications were accepted by Atari
Consumer Division engineering and marketing decision makers including LSI chip
designer Jay Miner (Synertek/Atari), director of Consumer engineering M. John
Ellis, VP research Al Alcorn, director of microelectronics Bob Brown, and
Manager of Product Planning John Vurich.  Two products were envisioned: a
'serious work' machine and an 'entertainment machine'. (Atari Inc.: Business
is Fun, p. 450-451)

Jay Miner would be chief system architect and chip designer for the Atari
"Colleen" home computer project (as he had been for the Atari VCS project).
Team members under Miner would include: Joe Decuir, Francois Michel, George
McCleod, Doug Neubauer, Scott Shiffman, Alan Miller, Howard Bornstein.  Mike
Albaugh of Atari (Coin-Op) would have significant influence with Miner and
Decuir on certain design considerations as well.  (Atari Inc.: Business is
Fun, p. 454)

Fall?: Atari and Dorsett Educational Systems reached a licensing agreement
that would bring Dorsett's Talk &amp; Teach Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI)
System to Atari personal computer systems.

November 29: The Atari "Colleen" project consisted of three design 
variations:
  o "Colleen" - the 'serious' machine (would ship as: 800)
  o "Candy" - new name for the 'entertainment' machine (would ship as: 400)
  o "Elizabeth" - same as "Colleen" but with a built-in 13 inch color monitor
    (never shipped)
(Atari Inc.: Business is Fun, p. 453)

November/December: M. John Ellis, previously director of consumer engineering,
was promoted to Atari VP Consumer Engineering (new position).  Atari engineer
Wade Tuma would be promoted to Director of Consumer Engineering (replacing the
promoted Ellis in the role).

December: "Several other new personal computers, in the PET/TRS-80 price range,
are coming soon...Atari (another video game manufacturer), and a European and
Japenese [sic] company are also expected to enter the competition."
(Micro #2 Dec77 p18; reprinted from "Northwest Computer Club News" Oct77)

1978
January: "Other manufacturers are also looking at TV games as the way to enter
the home-computing market.  Atari is said to be working on a programmable unit
featuring color graphics; it will use either custom chips or a 6502 micro."
(ROM v1n7 Jan78 p60)

Winter: Atari acquired the right to port Microsoft BASIC M6502 8K Version to
the upcoming Atari personal computers.  See:
<a href=http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102722318>http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102722318</a>

Winter?: David Gjerdrum joined Atari (Consumer) as senior software engineer
(personal computers).

May/June: Atari "Colleen" housing and case designs were largely finalized, and
prototype development systems now physically resembled what would ship as the
800.  Key specifications for "Candy" including whether it would have a
keyboard or the SIO port, and whether it would be RAM-expandable, remained in
flux.  (Atari Inc.: Business is Fun, p. 460)

June: Atari (Consumer) hired Liza Loop of the LO*OP Center ("Learning Options
Open Portal") as an educational technology consultant and technical writer for
Atari personal computer systems.  She interviewed with Atari director of
consumer engineering Wade Tuma, and would report to LSI design manager Richard
Simone.

Month?: Peter N. Rosenthal joined Atari (Consumer) as a marketing research
associate (personal computers).

Summer?: Atari pre-announced that the Atari computer would debut at the 
January 1979 Consumer Electronics Show.

September: At Atari (Consumer), programmers David Crane, Alan Miller, and
Larry Kaplan were temporarily allocated by director of software development
George Simcock to home computer project chief architect Jay Miner to take over
the creation of the operating system and a BASIC for the "Colleen" project.

(<a href=http://www.gooddealgames.com/interviews/int_David_Crane.html>http://www.gooddealgames.com/interviews/int_David_Crane.html</a>)

October 6: Atari contracted with Shepardson Microsystems, Inc. (SMI, headed by
Bob Shepardson) to create both a version of BASIC and a File Management
Subsystem (FMS) for the upcoming Atari personal computers.  The contract
called for delivery by April 6, 1979.  Atari planned to take an early, 8K
Microsoft BASIC to the CES (in Las Vegas) in January, 1979, and then switch
BASICs later.

Fall?: Peter Rosenthal, previously Atari (Consumer) marketing research
associate, became Atari (Consumer) Manager of Software Planning (personal
computers).

November: The Atari "Colleen" computer was named the 800 (now to ship with
8KiB RAM), and the "Candy" machine was named the 400 (to ship with 4KiB RAM). 
The 400, which did not yet have a final case design, would not have a
keyboard, but would support an external keyboard connected through controller
ports 3-4. (Atari Inc.: Business is Fun, p. 460)

December 6: "Last week Atari...disclosed that it was on the verge of
introducing its first home computers." (NYT p.D4)

December: SMI delivered working versions of BASIC and a disk FMS to Atari.

1979
January 6-9: At the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, during the Winter Consumer
Electronics Show (which was held at the Las Vegas Convention Center, Hilton
hotel, and Jockey Club hotel), Atari and Warner Communications Inc. displayed
the new Atari-400 Personal Computer and the Atari-800 Personal Computer.  The
400 would come with 8KiB of RAM and was expected to retail for approximately

older games now hard to find.  The second commercial stated the XE played both
disk and cartridge games while the Nintendo played only cartridge games.

separately, Nintendo said the claim was misleading because the disk drive was
expensive and hard to find.

Northern District of California, denied the October 23, 1988 request by
